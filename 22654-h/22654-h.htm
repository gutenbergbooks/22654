<h4>IN WHICH CERTAIN SUSPICIONS ARE EXCITED</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">A grey</span>, sunless morning on the Firth of Tay.</p>

<p>Across a wide, sandy waste stretching away
to the misty sea at Budden, four men were walking.
Two wore uniform&mdash;one an alert, grey-haired
general, sharp and brusque in manner,
with many war ribbons across his tunic; the
other a tall, thin-faced staff captain, who wore
the tartan of the Gordon Highlanders. With
them were two civilians, both in rough shooting-jackets
and breeches, one about forty-five, the
other a few years his junior.</p>

<p>"Can you see them, Fellowes?" asked the
general of the long-legged captain, scanning the
distant horizon with those sharp grey eyes which
had carried him safely through many campaigns.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the captain, who was
carrying the other's mackintosh. "I fancy they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
must be farther over to the left, behind those
low mounds yonder."</p>

<p>"Haven't brought their battery into position
yet, I suppose," snapped the old officer, as he
swung along with the two civilians beside him.</p>

<p>Fred Tredennick, the taller of the two civilians,
walked with a gait decidedly military, for,
indeed, he was a retired major, and as the general
had made a tour of inspection of the camp
prior to walking towards where the mountain
battery was man&#339;uvring, he had been chatting
with him upon technical matters.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like to see this mountain
battery, Fetherston," exclaimed the general,
addressing the other civilian. "We have lots of
them on the Indian frontier, of course, and there
were many of ours in Italy and Serbia."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to come with you on this
tour of inspection, General. As you know, I'm
keenly interested in military affairs&mdash;and especially
in the reorganisation of the Army after
the war," replied Walter Fetherston, a dark,
well-set-up man of forty, with a round, merry
face and a pair of eyes which, behind their gold
pince-nez, showed a good-humoured twinkle.</p>

<p>Of the four men, General Sir Hugh Elcombe
and Walter Fetherston were, perhaps, equally
distinguished. The former, as all the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
knows, had had a brilliant career in Afghanistan,
in Egypt, Burmah, Tirah, the Transvaal,
and in France, and now held an appointment as
inspector of artillery.</p>

<p>The latter was a man of entirely different
stamp. As he spoke he gesticulated slightly, and
no second glance was needed to realise that he
was a thorough-going cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>By many years of life on the Continent he
had acquired a half-foreign appearance. Indeed,
a keen observer would probably have noticed
that his clothes had been cut by a foreign tailor,
and that his boots, long, narrow and rather
square-toed, bore the stamp of the Italian boot-maker.
When he made any humorous remark
he had the habit of slightly closing the left eye
in order to emphasise it, while he usually walked
with his left hand behind his back, and was
hardly ever seen without a cigarette. Those
cigarettes were one of his idiosyncrasies. They
were delicious, of a brand unobtainable by the
public, and made from tobacco grown in one of
the Balkan States. With them he had, both before
the war and after, been constantly supplied
by a certain European sovereign whose personal
friend he was. They bore the royal crown and
cipher, but even to his most intimate acquaintance
Walter Fetherston had never betrayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
the reason why he was the recipient of so many
favours from the monarch in question.</p>

<p>Easy-going to a degree, full of open-hearted
<i>bonhomie</i>, possessing an unruffled temper, and
apparently without a single care in all the world,
he seldom, if ever, spoke of himself. He never
mentioned either his own doings or his friends'.
He was essentially a mysterious man&mdash;a man of
moods and of strong prejudices.</p>

<p>More than one person who had met him casually
had hinted that his substantial income was
derived from sources that would not bear investigation&mdash;that
he was mixed up with certain
financial adventurers. Others declared that he
was possessed of a considerable fortune that had
been left him by an uncle who had been a dealer
in precious stones in Hatton Garden. The
truth was, however, that Walter Fetherston was
a writer of popular novels, and from their sale
alone he derived a handsome income.</p>

<p>The mystery stories of Walter Fetherston
were world-famous. Wherever the English
language was spoken this shrewd-eyed, smiling
man's books were read, while translations of
them appeared as <i>feuilletons</i> in various languages
in the principal Continental journals.
One could scarcely take up an English newspaper
without seeing mention of his name, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
he was one of the most popular authors of the
day.</p>

<p>It is a generally accepted axiom that a public
man cannot afford to be modest in these go-ahead
days of "boom." Yet Fetherston was one of
the most retiring of men. English society had
tried in vain to allure him&mdash;he courted no personal
popularity. Beyond his quiet-spoken
literary agent, who arranged his affairs and took
financial responsibility from his shoulders, his
publishers, and perhaps half a dozen intimate
friends, he was scarcely recognised in his true
character. Indeed, his whereabouts were seldom
known save to his agent and his only brother,
so elusive was he and so careful to establish a
second self.</p>

<p>He had never married. It was whispered
that he had once had a serious affair of the heart
abroad. But that was a matter of long ago.</p>

<p>Shoals of invitations arrived at his London
clubs each season, but they usually reached him
in some out-of-the-world corner of Europe, and
he would read them with a smile and cast them
to the winds.</p>

<p>He took the keenest delight in evading the
world that pressed him. His curious hatred of
his own popularity was to everyone a mystery.
His intimate friends, of whom Fred Tredennick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
was one, had whispered that, in order to efface
his identity, he was known in certain circles
abroad by the name of Maltwood. This was
quite true. In London he was a member of
White's and the Devonshire as Fetherston.
There was a reason why on the Continent and
elsewhere he should pass as Mr. Maltwood, but
his friends could never discover it, so carefully
did he conceal it.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston was a writer of breathless
mystery&mdash;but he was the essence of mystery himself.
Once the reader took up a book of his
he never laid it down until he had read the final
chapter. You, my reader, have more than once
found yourself beneath his strange spell. And
what was the secret of his success? He had been
asked by numberless interviewers, and to them
all he had made the same stereotyped reply:
"I live the mysteries I write."</p>

<p>He seemed annoyed by his own success.
Other writers suffered from that complaint
known as "swelled head," but Walter Fetherston
never. He lived mostly abroad in order to
avoid the penalty which all the famous must pay,
travelling constantly and known mostly by his
assumed name of Maltwood.</p>

<p>And behind all this some mystery lay. He
was essentially a man of secrets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
Some people declared that he had married
ten years ago, and gave a circumstantial account
of how he had wedded the daughter of a noble
Spanish house, but that a month later she had
been accidentally drowned in the Bay of Fontarabia,
and that the tragedy had ever preyed
upon his mind. But upon his feminine entanglements
he was ever silent. He was a merry fellow,
full of bright humour, and excellent company.
But to the world he wore a mask that
was impenetrable.</p>

<p>At that moment he was shooting with his
old friend Tredennick, who lived close to St.
Fillans, on the picturesque Loch Earn, when the
general, hearing of his presence in the neighbourhood,
had sent him an invitation to accompany
him on his inspection.</p>

<p>Walter had accepted for one reason only.
In the invitation the general had remarked that
he and his stepdaughter Enid were staying at
the Panmure Hotel at Monifieth&mdash;so well known
to golfers&mdash;and that after the inspection he
hoped they would lunch together.</p>

<p>Now, Walter had met Enid Orlebar six
months before at Biarritz, where she had been
nursing at the Croix Rouge Hospital in the
H&ocirc;tel du Palais, and the memory of that meeting
had lingered with him. He had long desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
to see her again, for her pale beauty had somehow
attracted him&mdash;attracted him in a manner
that no woman's face had ever attracted him
before.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had held cynical notions concerning
love and matrimony, but ever since he had
met Enid Orlebar in that winter hotel beside
the sea, and had afterwards discovered her to
be stepdaughter of Sir Hugh Elcombe, he had
found himself reflecting upon his own loneliness.</p>

<p>At luncheon he was to come face to face
with her again. It was of this he was thinking
more than of the merits of mountain batteries or
the difficulties of limbering or unlimbering.</p>

<p>"See! there they are!" exclaimed the general,
suddenly pointing with his gloved hand.</p>

<p>Fetherston strained his eyes towards the
horizon, but declared that he could detect
nothing.</p>

<p>"They're lying behind that rising ground to
the left of the magazine yonder," declared the
general, whose keen vision had so often served
him in good stead. Then, turning on his heel
and scanning the grey horizon seaward, he
added: "They're going to fire out on to the Gaa
between those two lighthouses on Buddon Ness.
By Jove!" he laughed, "the men in them will
get a bit of a shock."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
"I shouldn't care much to be there, sir," remarked
Tredennick.</p>

<p>"No," laughed the general. "But really
there's no danger&mdash;except that we're just in the
line of their fire."</p>

<p>So they struck off to the left and approached
the position by a circuitous route, being greeted
by the colonel and other officers, to whom the
visit of Sir Hugh Elcombe had been a considerable
surprise.</p>

<p>The serviceable-looking guns were already
mounted and in position, the range had been
found; the reserves, the ponies and the pipers
were lying concealed in a depression close at
hand when they arrived.</p>

<p>The general, after a swift glance around,
stood with legs apart and arms folded to watch,
while Fetherston and Tredennick, with field-glasses,
had halted a little distance away.</p>

<p>A sharp word of command was given, when
next instant the first gun boomed forth, and
a shell went screaming through the air towards
the low range of sand-hills in the distance.</p>

<p>The general grunted. He was a man of few
words, but a typical British officer of the type
which has made the Empire and won the war
against the Huns. He glanced at the watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
upon his wrist, adjusted his monocle, and said
something in an undertone to the captain.</p>

<p>The firing proceeded, while Fetherston, his
ears dulled by the constant roar, watched the
bursting shells with interest.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the lighthouse men think of
it now?" he laughed, turning to his friend. "A
misdirected shot would send them quickly to
kingdom come!"</p>

<p>Time after time the range was increased, until,
at last, the shells were dropped just at the
spot intended. As each left the gun it shrieked
overhead, while the flash could be seen long before
the report reached the ear.</p>

<p>"We'll see in a few moments how quickly
they can get away," the general said, as he approached
Fetherston.</p>

<p>Then the order was given to cease fire.
Words of command sounded, and were repeated
in the rear, where ponies and men lay hidden.
The guns were run back under cover, and with
lightning rapidity dismounted, taken to pieces,
and loaded upon the backs of the ponies, together
with the leather ammunition cases&mdash;which looked
like men's suit cases&mdash;and other impedimenta.</p>

<p>The order was given to march, and, headed
by the pipers, who commenced their inspiring
skirl to the beat of the drums, they moved away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
over the rough, broken ground, the general
standing astraddle and watching it all through
his monocle with critical eye, and keeping up a
fire of sarcastic comment directed at the colonel.</p>

<p>"Why!" he cried sharply in his low, strident
voice, "what's that bay there? Too weak for
the work&mdash;no good. You want better stuff than
that. An axle yonder not packed properly! . . .
And look at that black pony&mdash;came out of
a governess-cart, I should think! . . . Hey, you
man there, you don't want to hang on that
pack! Men get lazy and want the pony to help
them along. And you&mdash;&mdash;" he cried, as a pony,
heavily laden with part of a gun, came down
an almost perpendicular incline. "Let that animal
find his way down alone. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Then, after much man&#339;uvring, he caused
them to take up another position, unlimber their
guns, and fire.</p>

<p>When this had been accomplished he called
the officers together and, his monocle in his eye,
severely criticised their performance, declaring
that they had exposed themselves so fully to the
enemy that ere they had had time to fire they
would have been shelled out of their position.</p>

<p>The spare ammunition was exposed all over
the place, some of the reserves were not under
cover, and the battery commander so exposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
himself that he'd have been a dead man before
the first shot. "You must do better than this&mdash;much
better. That's all."</p>

<p>Then the four walked across to the Panmure
Hotel at Monifieth.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston held his breath. His lips
were pressed tightly together, his brows contracted.
He was again to meet Enid Orlebar.</p>

<p>He shot a covert glance at the general walking
at his side. In his eyes showed an unusual
expression, half of suspicion, half of curiosity.</p>

<p>Next instant, however, it had vanished, and
he laughed loudly at a story Tredennick was
telling.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h4>THE COMING OF A STRANGER</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Enid</span> was standing on the steps of the hotel when
the men arrived.</p>

<p>For a second Walter glanced into her splendid
eyes, and then bowed over her hand in his
foreign way, a murmured expression of pleasure
escaping his lips.</p>

<p>About twenty-two, tall and slim, she presented
a complete and typical picture of the outdoor
girl, dressed as she was in a grey jumper
trimmed with purple, a short golfing skirt, her
tweed hat to match trimmed with the feathers
of a cock pheasant.</p>

<p>Essentially a sportswoman, she could handle
gun or rod, ride to hounds, or drive a motor-car
with equal skill, and as stepdaughter of Sir
Hugh she had had experience on the Indian
frontier and in Egypt.</p>

<p>Her father had been British Minister at the
Hague, and afterwards at Stockholm, but after
his death her mother had married Sir Hugh, and
had become Lady Elcombe. Nowadays, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>ever,
the latter was somewhat of an invalid, and
seldom left their London house in Hill Street.
Therefore, Enid was usually chaperoned by Mrs.
Caldwell, wife of the well-known K.C., and with
her she generally spent her winters on the
Continent.</p>

<p>Blanche, Sir Hugh's daughter by his first
wife, had married Paul Le Pontois, who had
been a captain in the 114th Regiment of Artillery
of the French Army during the war, and
lived with her husband in France. She seldom
came to England, though at frequent intervals
her father went over to visit her.</p>

<p>When Walter Fetherston took his seat beside
Enid Orlebar at the luncheon table a flood
of strange recollections crowded upon his mind&mdash;those
walks along the Miramar, that excursion
to Pampeluna, and those curious facts which she
had unwittingly revealed to him in the course of
their confidential chats. He remembered their
leave-taking, and how, as he had sat in the
<i>rapide</i> for Paris, he had made a solemn vow
never again to set eyes upon her.</p>

<p>There was a reason why he should not&mdash;a
strong but mysterious reason.</p>

<p>Yet he had come there of his own will to
meet her again&mdash;drawn there irresistibly by some
unseen influence which she possessed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
Was it her beauty that had attracted him?
Yes&mdash;he was compelled to admit that it was.
As a rule he avoided the society of women. To
his intimates he had laid down the maxim:
"Don't marry; keep a dog if you want a faithful
companion." And yet he was once again
at the side of this fair-faced woman.</p>

<p>None around the table were aware of their
previous meeting, and all were too busy chattering
to notice the covert glances which he shot at
her. He was noting her great beauty, sitting
there entranced by it&mdash;he, the man of double
personality, who, under an assumed name, lived
that gay life of the Continent, known in society
in twenty different cities, and yet in England
practically unknown in his real self.</p>

<p>Yes, Enid Orlebar was beautiful. Surely
there could be few fairer women than she in
this our land of fair women!</p>

<p>Turning upon him, she smiled gaily as she
asked whether he had been interested in seeing
a mountain battery at work.</p>

<p>Her fresh face, betraying, as it did, her love
of a free, open-air life, was one of those strangely
mysterious countenances met only once in a lifetime.
It seemed to be the quintessence of pain
and passion, conflict and agony, desire and despair.
She was not one of those befrilled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
fashion-plate dolls that one meets at the after-war
crushes and dances, but was austerely simple
in dress, with a face which betrayed a spiritual
nobility, the very incarnation of modern womanhood,
alive with modern self-knowledge, modern
weariness and modern sadness.</p>

<p>Her beautiful hair, worn plain and smooth,
was black as night&mdash;wonderful hair. But still
more wonderful were those great, dark, velvety
eyes, deep and unfathomable. In them the
tragedy of life was tumultuously visible, yet they
were serene, self-possessed, even steady in their
quiet simplicity. To describe her features is
not an easy task. They were clear-cut, with a
purity of the lines of the nose and brow seldom
seen in a woman's face, dark, well-arched eyebrows,
a pretty mouth which had just escaped
extreme sensuousness. Cheeks soft and delicately
moulded, a chin pointed, a skin remarkable
for its fineness and its clear pallor, the
whole aspect of her face being that of sweetness
combined with nobility and majesty. In it there
was no dominant expression, for it seemed to be
a mask waiting to be stirred into life.</p>

<p>Fetherston had known Sir Hugh slightly for
several years, but as Enid had been so much
abroad with Mrs. Caldwell, he had never met
her until that accidental encounter in Biarritz.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
"We've been up here six weeks," she was telling
Fetherston. "Father always gets a lot of
golf up here, you know, and I'm rather fond
of it."</p>

<p>"I fear I'm too much of a foreigner nowadays
to appreciate the game," Walter laughed.
"Last season some Italians in Rome formed a
club&mdash;the usual set of ultra-smart young counts
and marquises&mdash;but when they found that it entailed
the indignity of walking several miles
they declared it to be a game only fit for the
populace, and at once disbanded the association."</p>

<p>The men were discussing the work of the
battery, for four of the officers had been invited,
and the point raised was the range of mountain
guns.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston glanced at the general
through his pince-nez with a curious expression,
but he did not join in the conversation.</p>

<p>Enid's eyes met his, and the pair exchanged
curiously significant glances.</p>

<p>He bent to pick up his serviette, and in doing
so he whispered to her: "I must see you
outside for a moment before I go. Go out, and
I'll join you."</p>

<p>Therefore, when the meal had concluded, the
girl went forth into the secluded garden at the
rear of the hotel, where in a few moments the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
man joined her at a spot where they could not
be overlooked.</p>

<p>She turned towards him, separate, remote,
incongruous, her dark eyes showing an angry
flash in them.</p>

<p>"Why have you come here?" she demanded
with indignation. The whole aspect of her face
was tragic.</p>

<p>"To see you again," was his brief reply.
"Before we parted at Biarritz you lied to me,"
he added in a hard tone.</p>

<p>She held her breath, staring straight into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand you!" she stammered.
"You are here to torment&mdash;to persecute
me!"</p>

<p>"I asked you a question, Enid, but in response
you told me a deliberate lie. Think&mdash;recall
that circumstance, and tell me the truth,"
he said very quietly.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Then, with
her mouth drawn to hardness, she replied: "Yes,
it is true&mdash;I lied to you, just as you have lied
to me. Remember what you told me that moonlit
night when we walked by the sea towards the
Grotto of Love. I was a fool to have believed
in you&mdash;to have trusted you as I did! You left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
me, and, though I wrote time after time to your
club, you refused to send me a single line."</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because, Enid, I dared not," replied
her companion.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she demanded quickly. "You
told me that you loved me, yet&mdash;yet your own
actions have shown that you lied to me!"</p>

<p>"No," he protested in a low, earnest, hoarse
voice; "I told you the truth, Enid, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" she interrupted in quickly
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied after a brief pause, "the
fact is that I am compelled to wear a mask, even
to you, the woman I love. I cannot tell you the
truth&mdash;I cannot, dearest, for your own sake."</p>

<p>"And you expect me to believe this lame
story&mdash;eh?" she laughed. She was pale and
fragile, yet she seemed to expand and to dilate
with force and energy.</p>

<p>"Enid," he answered in a low voice, with
honesty in his eyes, "I would rather sacrifice my
great love for you than betray the trust I hold
most sacred. So great is my love for you, rather
would I never look upon your dear face again
than reveal to you the tragic truth and bring
upon you unhappiness and despair."</p>

<p>"Walter," she replied in a trembling voice,
looking straight into his countenance with those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
wonderful dark eyes wherein her soul brimmed
over with weary emotion and fatigued passion,
"I repeat all that I told you on that calm night
beside the sea. I love you; I think of you day
by day, hour by hour. But you have lied to me,
and therefore I hate myself for having so foolishly
placed my trust in you."</p>

<p>He had resolved to preserve his great secret&mdash;a
secret that none should know.</p>

<p>"Very well," he sighed, shrugging his
shoulders. "These recriminations are really all
useless. Ah, if you only knew the truth, Enid!
If I only dared to reveal to you the hideous facts.
But I refuse&mdash;they are too tragic, too terrible.
Better that we should part now, and that you
should remain in ignorance&mdash;better by far, for
you. You believe that I am deceiving you. Well,
I'm frank and admit that I am; but it is with a
distinct purpose&mdash;for your own sake."</p>

<p>He held forth his hand, and slowly she took
it. In silence he bowed over it, his lips compressed;
then, turning upon his heel, he went
down the gravelled walk back to the hotel, which,
some ten minutes later, he left with Fred Tredennick,
catching the train back to Dundee and
on to Perth.</p>

<p>He was in no way a man to wear his heart
upon his sleeve, therefore he chatted gaily with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
his friend and listened to Fred's extravagant admiration
of Enid's beauty. He congratulated
himself that his old friend was in ignorance of
the truth.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred at the hotel that
same evening, however, which, had Walter been
aware of it, would probably have caused him
considerable uneasiness and alarm. Just before
seven o'clock a tall, rather thin, middle-aged,
narrow-eyed man, dressed in dark grey tweeds,
entered the hall of the hotel and inquired for
Henry, the head waiter. He was well dressed
and bore an almost professional air.</p>

<p>The white-headed old man quickly appeared,
when the stranger, whose moustache was carefully
trimmed and who wore a ruby ring upon
his white hand, made an anxious inquiry whether
Fetherston, whom he minutely described, had
been there that day. At first the head waiter
hesitated and was uncommunicative, but, the
stranger having uttered a few low words,
Henry's manner instantly changed. He started,
looked in wonder into the stranger's face, and,
taking him into the smoking-room&mdash;at that moment
unoccupied&mdash;he allowed himself to be
closely questioned regarding the general and his
stepdaughter, as well as the man who had that
day been their guest. The stranger was a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
of quick actions, and his inquiries were sharp
and to the point.</p>

<p>"You say that Mr. Fetherston met the young
lady outside after luncheon, and they had an
argument in secret, eh?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>Henry replied in the affirmative, declaring
that he unfortunately could not overhear the
subject under discussion. But he believed the
pair had quarrelled.</p>

<p>"And where has Mr. Fetherston gone?"
asked his keen-eyed questioner.</p>

<p>"He is, I believe, the guest of Major Tredennick,
who lives on the other side of Perthshire
at Invermay on Loch Earn."</p>

<p>"And the young lady goes back to Hill
Street with her stepfather, eh?"</p>

<p>"On Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Good!" was the stranger's reply. Then,
thanking the head waiter for the information in
a sharp, businesslike voice, and handing him five
shillings, he took train back from Monifieth to
Dundee, and went direct to the chief post-office.</p>

<p>From there he dispatched a carefully constructed
cipher telegram to an address in the
Boulevard Anspach, in Brussels, afterwards
lighting an excellent cigar and strolling along
the busy street with an air of supreme self-satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
"If this man, Fetherston, has discovered the
truth, as I fear he has done," the hard-faced man
muttered to himself, "then by his action to-day
he has sealed his own doom!&mdash;and Enid Orlebar
herself will silence him!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h4>INTRODUCES DOCTOR WEIRMARSH</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> days had elapsed.</p>

<p>In the dingy back room of a dull, drab house
in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, close to Victoria
Station in London, the narrow-eyed man who
had so closely questioned old Henry at the Panmure
Hotel, sat at an old mahogany writing-table
reading a long letter written upon thin
foreign notepaper.</p>

<p>The incandescent gas-lamp shed a cold glare
across the room. On one side of the smoke-grimed
apartment was a shabby leather couch, on
the other side a long nest of drawers, while beside
the fireplace was an expanding gas-bracket
placed in such a position that it could be used
to examine anyone seated in the big arm-chair.
Pervading the dingy apartment was a faint smell
of carbolic, for it was a consulting-room, and
the man so intent upon the letter was Dr. Weirmarsh,
the hard-working practitioner so well
known among the lower classes in Pimlico.</p>

<p>Those who pass along the Vauxhall Bridge
Road know well that house with its curtains yel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>low
with smoke&mdash;the one which stands back behind
a small strip of smoke-begrimed garden.
Over the gate is a red lamp, and upon the railings
a brass plate with the name: "Mr. Weirmarsh,
Surgeon."</p>

<p>About three years previously he had bought
the practice from old Dr. Bland, but he lived
alone, a silent and unsociable man, with a deaf
old housekeeper, although he had achieved a considerable
reputation among his patients in the
neighbouring by-streets. But his practice was
not wholly confined to the poorer classes, for he
was often consulted by well-dressed members of
the foreign colony&mdash;on account, probably, of his
linguistic attainments. A foreigner with an imperfect
knowledge of English naturally prefers
a doctor to whom he can speak in his own tongue.
Therefore, as Weirmarsh spoke French, Italian
and Spanish with equal fluency, it was not surprising
that he had formed quite a large practice
among foreign residents.</p>

<p>His appearance, however, was the reverse
of prepossessing, and his movements were often
most erratic. About his aquiline face was a
shrewd and distrustful expression, while his
keen, dark eyes, too narrowly set, were curiously
shifty and searching. When absent, as he often
was, a young fellow named Shipley acted as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
locum tenens, but so eccentric was he that even
Shipley knew nothing of the engagements which
took him from home so frequently.</p>

<p>George Weirmarsh was a man of few friends
and fewer words. He lived for himself alone,
devoting himself assiduously to his practice, and
doing much painstaking writing at the table
whereat he now sat, or else, when absent, travelling
swiftly with aims that were ever mysterious.</p>

<p>He had had a dozen or so patients that evening,
but the last had gone, and he had settled
himself to read the letter which had arrived when
his little waiting-room had been full of people.</p>

<p>As he read he made scribbled notes on a piece
of paper upon his blotting-pad, his thin, white
hand, delicate as a woman's, bearing that splendid
ruby ring, his one possession in which he
took a pride.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he remarked to himself in a hard
tone of sarcasm, "what fools the shrewdest of
men are sometimes over a woman! So at last
he's fallen&mdash;like the others&mdash;and the secret will
be mine. Most excellent! After all, every man
has one weak point in his armour, and I was not
mistaken."</p>

<p>Then he paused, and, leaning his chin upon
his hand, looked straight before him, deep in
reflection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
"I have few fears&mdash;very few," he remarked
to himself, "but the greatest is of Walter
Fetherston. What does he know?&mdash;that's the
chief question. If he has discovered the truth&mdash;if
he knows my real name and who I am&mdash;then
the game's up, and my best course is to leave
England. And yet there is another way," he
went on, speaking slowly to himself&mdash;"to close
his lips. Dead men tell no tales."</p>

<p>He sat for a long time, his narrow-set eyes
staring into space, contemplating a crime. As
a medical man, he knew a dozen ingenious ways
by which Walter Fetherston might be sent to
his grave in circumstances that would appear
perfectly natural. His gaze at last wandered
to the book-case opposite, and became centred
upon a thick, brown-covered, dirty volume by
a writer named Taylor. That book contained
much that might be of interest to him in the
near future.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the handle of the door turned,
and Mrs. Kelsey, the old housekeeper, in rusty
black, admitted Enid Orlebar without the ceremony
of asking permission to enter.</p>

<p>The girl was dressed in a pearl grey and pink
sports coat, with a large black hat, and carried
a silver chain handbag. Around her throat was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
a white feather boa, while her features were half
concealed by the veil she wore.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear young lady," cried Weirmarsh,
rising quickly and greeting her, while next moment
he turned to his table and hastily concealed
the foreign letter and notes, "I had quite forgotten
that you were to consult me. Pray forgive
me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive," the beautiful
girl replied in a low, colourless voice, when the
housekeeper had disappeared, and she had seated
herself in the big leather arm-chair in which so
many patients daily sat. "You ordered me to
come here to you, and I have come."</p>

<p>"Against your will, eh?" he asked slowly,
with a strange look in his keen eyes.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly well now. I do not see why
my stepfather should betray such anxiety on my
account."</p>

<p>"The general is greatly concerned about
you," Weirmarsh said, seated cross-legged at his
writing-chair, toying with his pen and looking
into the girl's handsome face.</p>

<p>"He wished me to see you. That is why I
wrote to you."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, wavering beneath his sharp
glance, "I am here. What do you wish?"</p>

<p>"I wish to have a little private talk with you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
Miss Enid," he replied thoughtfully, stroking
his small greyish moustache, "a talk concerning
your own welfare."</p>

<p>"But I am not ill," she cried. "I don't see
why you should desire me to come to you to-night."</p>

<p>"I have my own reasons, my dear young
lady," was the man's firm response, his eyes
fixed immovably upon hers. "And I think you
know me well enough to be aware that when Dr.
Weirmarsh sets his mind upon a thing he is not
easily turned aside."</p>

<p>A slight, almost imperceptible, shudder ran
through her. But Weirmarsh detected it, and
knew that this girl of extraordinary and mysterious
charm was as wax in his hands. In the
presence of the man who had cast such a strange
spell about her she was utterly helpless. There
was no suggestion of hypnotism&mdash;she herself
scouted the idea&mdash;yet ever since Sir Hugh had
taken her to consult this man of medicine at a
small suburban villa, five years ago, he had entered
her life never again to leave it.</p>

<p>She realised herself irresistibly in his power
whenever she felt his presence near her. At his
bidding she came and went, and against her better
nature she acted as he commanded.</p>

<p>He had cured her of an attack of nerves five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
years ago, but she had ever since been beneath
his hated thraldom. His very eyes fascinated
her with their sinister expression, yet to her
he could do no wrong.</p>

<p>A thousand times she had endeavoured to
break free from that strong but unseen influence,
but she always became weak and easily led as
soon as she fell beneath the extraordinary power
which the obscure doctor possessed. Time after
time he called her to his side, as on this occasion,
on pretence of prescribing for her, and yet with
an ulterior motive. Enid Orlebar was a useful
tool in the hands of this man who was so unscrupulous.</p>

<p>She sighed, passing her gloved hand wearily
across her hot brow. Strange how curiously his
presence always affected her!</p>

<p>She had read in books of the mysteries of
hypnotic suggestion, but she was far too practical
to believe in that. This was not hypnotism, she
often declared within herself, but some remarkable
and unknown power possessed by this man
who, beneath the guise of the hard-working surgeon,
was engaged in schemes of remarkable
ingenuity and wondrous magnitude.</p>

<p>He held her in the palm of his hand. He
held her for life&mdash;or for death.</p>

<p>To her stepfather she had, times without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
number, expressed fear and horror of the sharp-eyed
doctor, but Sir Hugh had only laughed at
her fears and dismissed them as ridiculous. Dr.
Weirmarsh was the general's friend.</p>

<p>Enid knew that there was some close association
between the pair, but of its nature she was
in complete ignorance. Often the doctor came
to Hill Street and sat for long periods with the
general in that small, cosy room which was his
den. That they were business interviews there
was no doubt, but the nature of the business
was ever a mystery.</p>

<p>"I see by your face that, though there is a
great improvement in you, you are, nevertheless,
far from well," the man said, his eyes still
fixed upon her pale countenance.</p>

<p>"Dr. Weirmarsh," she protested, "this constant
declaration that I am ill is awful. I tell
you I am quite as well as you are yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah! there, I'm afraid, you are mistaken,
my dear young lady," he replied. "You may
feel well, but you are not in quite such good
health as you imagine. The general is greatly
concerned about you, and for that reason I
wished to see you to-night," he added with a smile
as, bending towards her, he asked her to remove
her glove.</p>

<p>He took her wrist, holding his stop-watch in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
his other hand. "Hum!" he grunted, "just as
I expected. You're a trifle low&mdash;a little run
down. You want a change."</p>

<p>"But we only returned from Scotland yesterday!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"The North does not suit such an exotic
plant as yourself," he said. "Go South&mdash;the
Riviera, Spain, Italy, or Egypt."</p>

<p>"I go with Mrs. Caldwell at the end of
November."</p>

<p>"No," he said decisively, "you must go now."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, opening her eyes in
astonishment at his dictatorial manner.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;" and he hesitated, still gazing
upon her with those strangely sinister eyes of his.
"Well, Miss Enid, because a complete change
will be beneficial to you in more ways than one,"
he replied with an air of mystery.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," she declared.</p>

<p>"Probably not," he laughed, with that cynical
air which so irritated her. She hated herself
for coming to that detestable house of grim
silence; yet his word to her was a command which
she felt impelled by some strange force to fulfil
with child-like obedience. "But I assure you I
am advising you for your own benefit, my dear
young lady."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
"Shall I speak plainly?" asked the man in
whose power she was. "Will you forgive me if
I so far intrude myself upon your private affairs
as to give you a few words of advice?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dr. Weirmarsh, but I cannot
see that my private affairs are any concern of
yours," she replied with some hauteur. How
often had she endeavoured in vain to break those
invisible shackles?</p>

<p>"I am a very sincere friend of your stepfather,
and I hope a sincere friend of yours also,"
he said with perfect coolness. "It is because
of this I presume to advise you&mdash;but, of
course&mdash;&mdash;" And he hesitated, without concluding
his sentence. His eyes were again fixed upon
her as though gauging accurately the extent of
his influence upon her.</p>

<p>"And what do you advise, pray?" she asked,
"It seems that you have called me to you to-night
in order to intrude upon my private affairs,"
she added, with her eyes flashing resentment.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes, Miss Enid," he answered, his
manner changing slightly. "The fact is, I wish
to warn you against what must inevitably bring
disaster both upon yourself and your family."</p>

<p>"Disaster?" she echoed. "I don't follow
you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
"Then let me speak a little more plainly,"
he replied, his strange, close-set eyes staring into
hers until she quivered beneath his cold, hard
gaze. "You have recently become acquainted
with Walter Fetherston. You met him at Biarritz
six months ago, and on Monday last he
lunched with you up at Monifieth. After
luncheon you met him in the garden of the hotel,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know all this?" she gasped,
startled, yet fascinated by his gaze.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," he laughed, "it is
my business to know certain things&mdash;that is one
of them."</p>

<p>She held her breath for a moment.</p>

<p>"And pray how does that concern you?
What interest have you in my acquaintances?"</p>

<p>"A very keen one," was the prompt reply.
"That man is dangerous to you&mdash;and to your
family. The reason why I have asked you here
to-night is to tell you that you must never meet
him again. If you value your life, and that of
your mother and her husband, avoid him as you
would some venomous reptile. He is your most
deadly enemy."</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment. Her great,
dark eyes were fixed upon the threadbare car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>pet.
What he told her was disconcerting, yet,
knowing instinctively, as she did, how passionately
Walter loved her, she could not bring herself
to believe that he was really her enemy.</p>

<p>"No, Dr. Weirmarsh," she replied, raising
her eyes again to his, "you are quite mistaken.
I know Walter Fetherston better than you.
Your allegation is false. You have told me this
because&mdash;because you have some motive in parting
us."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said frankly, "I have&mdash;<i>a strong
motive</i>."</p>

<p>"You do not conceal it?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "Were I a younger
man you might, perhaps, accuse me of scheming
to wriggle myself into your good graces, Miss
Enid. But I am getting old, and, moreover, I'm
a confirmed bachelor, therefore you cannot, I
think, accuse me of such ulterior motives. No,
I only point out this peril for your family's
sake&mdash;and your own."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Fetherston such an evil genius,
then?" she asked. "The world knows him as a
writer of strictly moral, if exciting, books."</p>

<p>"The books are one thing&mdash;the man himself
another. Some men reflect their own souls in
their works, others write but canting hypocrisy.
It is so with Walter Fetherston&mdash;the man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
has a dual personality and whose private life will
not bear the light of publicity."</p>

<p>"You wish to prejudice me against him,
eh?" she said in a hard tone.</p>

<p>"I merely wish to advise you for your good,
my dear young lady," he said. "It is not for
me, your medical man, to presume to dictate to
you, I know. But the general is my dear friend,
therefore I feel it my duty to reveal to you the
bitter truth."</p>

<p>Thoughts of Walter Fetherston, the man
in whose eyes had shone the light of true honesty
when he spoke, arose within her. She was well
aware of all the curious gossip concerning the
popular writer, whose eccentricities were so frequently
hinted at in the gossipy newspapers,
but she was convinced that she knew the real
Fetherston behind the mask he so constantly
wore.</p>

<p>This man before her was deceiving her. He
had some sinister motive in thus endeavouring to
plant seeds of suspicion within her mind. It was
plain that he was endeavouring in some way to
secure his own ends. Those ends, however, were
a complete and inexplicable mystery.</p>

<p>"I cannot see that my friendship for Mr.
Fetherston can have any interest for you," she
replied. "Let us talk of something else."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
"But it has," he persisted. "You must never
meet that man again&mdash;you hear! never&mdash;otherwise
you will discover to your cost that my serious
warning has a foundation only too solid;
that he is your bitterest enemy posing as your
most affectionate friend."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you, Dr. Weirmarsh!" she
cried resentfully, springing to her feet. "I'll
never believe you!"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," the man exclaimed,
"you are really quite unnerved to-night. The
general was quite right. I will mix you a draught
like the one you had before&mdash;perfectly innocuous&mdash;something
to soothe those unstrung nerves of
yours." And beneath his breath, as his cruel
eyes twinkled, he added: "Something to bring
reason to those warped and excited senses&mdash;something
to sow within you suspicion and hatred
of Walter Fetherston."</p>

<p>Then aloud he added, as he sprang to his
feet: "Excuse me for a moment while I go and
dispense it. I'll be back in a few seconds."</p>

<p>He left the room when, quick as lightning,
Enid stretched forth her hand to the drawer of
the writing-table into which she had seen the
doctor toss the foreign letter he had been reading
when she entered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
She drew it out, and scanned eagerly a dozen
or so of the closely-written lines in Spanish.</p>

<p>Then she replaced it with trembling fingers,
and, closing the drawer, sat staring straight before
her&mdash;dumbfounded, rigid.</p>

<p>What was the mystery?</p>

<p>By the knowledge she had obtained she became
forearmed&mdash;even defiant. In the light of
that astounding discovery, she now read the mysterious
Dr. Weirmarsh as she would an open
book. She held her breath, and an expression
of hatred escaped her lips.</p>

<p>When, a moment later, he brought her a
pale-yellow draught in a graduated glass, she
took it from his hand, and, drawing herself up in
defiance, flung its contents behind her into the
fireplace. She believed that at last she had conquered
that strangely evil influence which, emanating
from this obscure practitioner, had fallen
upon her.</p>

<p>But the man only shrugged his shoulders and,
turning from her, laughed unconcernedly. He
knew that he held her in bonds stronger than
steel, that his will was hers&mdash;for good or for
evil.</p>

<h4>REVEALS TEMPTATION</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I tell</span> you it can't be done&mdash;the risk is far too
great!" declared Sir Hugh Elcombe, standing
with his back to the fireplace in his cosy little
den in Hill Street at noon next day.</p>

<p>"It must be done," answered Dr. Weirmarsh,
who sat in the deep green leather arm-chair, with
the tips of his fingers placed together.</p>

<p>The general glanced suspiciously at the door
to reassure himself that it was closed.</p>

<p>"You ask too much," he said. Then, in a
decisive voice, while his fingers toyed nervously
with his monocle, he added, "I have resolved
to end it once and for all."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him with a strange expression
in those cold, keen eyes of his and smiled,
"I fear, Sir Hugh, that if you attempt to carry
out such a decision you will find insuperable
difficulties," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"I desire no good advice from you, Weirmarsh,"
the old general snapped. "I fully realise
my position. You have cornered me&mdash;cut off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
my retreat&mdash;so I have placed my back against
the wall."</p>

<p>"Good! And how will such an attitude
benefit you, pray?"</p>

<p>"Understand, I am in no mood to be taunted
by you!" the old man cried, with an angry
flash in his eyes. "You very cleverly enticed
me into the net, and now you are closing it
about me."</p>

<p>"My dear Sir Hugh," replied the doctor,
"ours was a mere business transaction, surely.
Carry your thoughts back to six years ago.
After your brilliant military career you returned
from India and found yourself, as so many of
your profession find themselves, in very straitened
circumstances. You were bound to keep up
appearances, and, in order to do so, got into
the hands of Eli Moser, the moneylender. You
married Lady Orlebar, and had entered London
society when, of a sudden, the scoundrelly usurer
began to put the screw upon you. At that moment
you&mdash;luckily, I think, for yourself&mdash;met
me, and&mdash;well, I was your salvation, for I
pointed out to you an easy way by which to pay
your creditors and rearrange your affairs upon
a sound financial basis. Indeed, I did it for you.
I saved you from the moneylender. Did I
not?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
He spoke in a calm, even tone, without once
removing his eyes from the man who stood upon
the hearthrug with bent head and folded arms.</p>

<p>"I know, Weirmarsh. It's true that you
saved me from bankruptcy&mdash;but think what
penalty I have paid by accepting your terms,"
he answered in a low, broken voice. "The devil
tempted me, and I fell into your damnable net."</p>

<p>"I hardly think it necessary for you to put
it that way," replied the doctor without the least
sign of annoyance. "I showed you how you
could secure quite a comfortable income, and you
readily enough adopted my suggestion."</p>

<p>"Readily!" echoed the fine-looking old soldier.
"Ah! you don't know what my decision
cost me&mdash;it has cost me my very life."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man," laughed the doctor scornfully.
"You got out of the hands of the Jews,
and ever since that day you haven't had five
minutes' worry over your finances. I promised
you I would provide you with an ample income,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you've done so, Weirmarsh," cried
the old general; "an income far greater than I
expected. Yet what do I deserve?"</p>

<p>"My dear General," said the doctor quite
calmly, "you're not yourself to-day; suffering
from a slight attack of remorse, eh? It's a bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
complaint; I've had it, and I know. But it's
like the measles&mdash;you're very nearly certain to
contract it once in a lifetime."</p>

<p>"Have you no pity for me?" snarled Sir
Hugh, glaring at the narrow-eyed man seated
before him. "Don't you realise that by this
last demand of yours you've driven me into a
corner?"</p>

<p>Weirmarsh's brows contracted slightly, and
he shot an evil glance at the man before him&mdash;the
man who was his victim. "But you must do
it. You still want money&mdash;and lots of it, don't
you?" he said in a low, decisive voice.</p>

<p>"I refuse, I tell you!" cried Sir Hugh
angrily.</p>

<p>"Hush! Someone may overhear," the doctor
said. "Is Enid at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I saw her last night, as you wished. She
is not well. Her nerves are still in an extremely
weak state," Weirmarsh said, in order to change
the topic of conversation. "I think you should
send her abroad out of the way&mdash;to the South
somewhere."</p>

<p>"So she told me. I shall try and get Mrs.
Caldwell to take her to Sicily&mdash;if you consider
the air would be beneficial."</p>

<p>"Excellent&mdash;Palermo or Taormina&mdash;send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
the girl there as soon as ever you can. She seems
unstrung, and may get worse; a change will
certainly do her good," replied the man whose
craft and cunning were unequalled. "I know,"
he added reflectively, "that Enid dislikes me&mdash;why,
I can never make out."</p>

<p>"Instinct, I suppose, Weirmarsh," was the
old man's reply. "She suspects that you hold
me in your power, as you undoubtedly do."</p>

<p>"Now that is really a most silly idea of
yours, Sir Hugh. Do get rid of it. Such a
thought pains me to a great degree," declared
the crafty-eyed man. "For these past years I
have provided you with a good income, enabling
you to keep up your position in the world, instead
of&mdash;well, perhaps shivering on the Embankment
at night and partaking of the hospitality
of the charitably disposed. Yet you upbraid
me as though I had treated you shabbily!"
He spoke with an irritating air of superiority,
for he knew that this man who occupied such a
high position, who was an intimate friend and
confidant of the Minister of War, and universally
respected throughout the country, was but a
tool in his unscrupulous hands.</p>

<p>"You ask me too much," exclaimed the grey-moustached
officer in a hard, low voice.</p>

<p>"The request does not emanate from me,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
was the doctor's reply; "I am but the mouthpiece."</p>

<p>"Yes, the mouthpiece&mdash;but the eyes and ears
also, Weirmarsh," replied Sir Hugh. "You
bought me, body and soul, for a wage of five
thousand pounds a year&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The salary of one of His Majesty's Ministers,"
interrupted the doctor. "It has been paid
you with regularity, together with certain extras.
When you have wished for a loan of five hundred
or so, I have never refused it."</p>

<p>"I quite admit that; but you've always received
a <i>quid pro quo</i>," the general snapped.
"Look at the thousands upon thousands I put
through for you!"</p>

<p>"The whole transaction has from the beginning
been a matter of business; and, as far as I
am concerned, I have fulfilled my part of the
contract."</p>

<p>The man standing upon the hearthrug sighed.
"I suppose," he said, "that I really have no right
to complain. I clutched at the straw you held
out to me, and saved myself at a cost greater
than the world can ever know. I hate myself
for it. If I had then known what I know now
concerning you and your friends, I would rather
have blown out my brains than have listened to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
your accursed words of temptation. The whole
plot is damnable!"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I am not Mephistopheles,"
laughed the narrow-eyed doctor.</p>

<p>"You are worse," declared the general boldly.
"You bought me body and soul, but by
Heaven!" he cried, "you have not bought my
family, sir!"</p>

<p>Weirmarsh moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"And so you refuse to do this service which
I requested of you, yesterday, eh?" he asked
very slowly.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>A silence fell between the two men, broken
only by the low ticking of the little Sheraton
clock upon the mantelshelf.</p>

<p>"Have you fully reflected upon what this
refusal of yours may cost you, General?" asked
the doctor in a slow, hard voice, his eyes fixed
upon the other's countenance.</p>

<p>"It will cost me just as much as you decide
it shall," was the response of the unhappy man,
who found himself enmeshed by the crafty
practitioner.</p>

<p>"You speak as though I were the principal,
whereas I am but the agent," Weirmarsh
protested.</p>

<p>"Principal or agent, my decision, Doctor, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
irrevocable&mdash;I refuse to serve your accursed ends
further."</p>

<p>"Really," laughed the other, still entirely
unruffled, "your attitude to-day is quite amusing.
You've got an attack of liver, and you should
allow me to prescribe for you."</p>

<p>The general made a quick gesture of impatience,
but did not reply.</p>

<p>It was upon the tip of Weirmarsh's tongue
to refer to Walter Fetherston, but next instant
he had reflected. If Sir Hugh really intended
to abandon himself to remorse and make a fool
of himself, why should he stretch forth a hand
to save him?</p>

<p>That ugly revelations&mdash;very ugly ones&mdash;might
result was quite within the range of possibility,
therefore Weirmarsh, whose craft and cunning
were amazing, intended to cover his own retreat
behind the back of the very man whom he
had denounced to Enid Orlebar.</p>

<p>He sat in silence, his finger-tips again joined,
gazing upon the man who had swallowed that
very alluring bait he had once placed before him.</p>

<p>He realised by Sir Hugh's manner that he
regretted his recent action and was now overcome
by remorse. Remorse meant exposure, and
exposure meant prosecution&mdash;a great public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
prosecution, which, at all hazards, must not be
allowed.</p>

<p>As he sat there he was actually calmly wondering
whether this fine old officer with such a
brilliant record would die in silence by his own
hand and carry his secret to the grave, or whether
he would leave behind some awkward written
statement which would incriminate himself and
those for whom he acted.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sir Hugh turned and, looking the
doctor squarely in the face as though divining
his inmost thoughts, said in a hoarse voice tremulous
with emotion: "Ah, you need not trouble
yourself further, Weirmarsh. I have a big dinner-party
to-night, but by midnight I shall have
paid the penalty which you have imposed upon
me&mdash;I shall have ceased to live. I will die rather
then serve you further!"</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear sir," replied the doctor,
rising from his chair abruptly. "Of course,
every man's life is his own property&mdash;you can
take it if you think fit&mdash;but I assure you that such
an event would not concern me in the least. I
have already taken the precaution to appear with
clean hands&mdash;should occasion require."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h4>IN WHICH ENID ORLEBAR IS PUZZLED</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night, around the general's dinner-table in
Hill Street, a dozen or so well-known men and
women were assembled.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Elcombe's dinners were always
smart gatherings. The table was set with
Georgian silver and decorated daintily with
flowers, while several of the women wore splendid
jewels. At the head sat Lady Elcombe, a quiet,
rather fragile, calm-faced woman in black, whose
countenance bore traces of long suffering, but
whose smile was very sweet.</p>

<p>Among the guests was Walter Fetherston,
whom the general had at last induced to visit
him, and he had taken in Enid, who looked superb
in a cream d&eacute;collet&eacute; gown, and who wore
round her throat a necklet of turquoise matrices,
admirably suited to her half-barbaric beauty.</p>

<p>Fetherston had only accepted the general's
invitation at her urgent desire, for she had written
to White's telling him that it was imperative
they should meet&mdash;she wished to consult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
him; she begged of him to forget the interview
at Monifieth and return to her.</p>

<p>So, against his will, he had gone there, though
the house and all it contained was hateful to
him. With that terrible secret locked within his
heart&mdash;that secret which gripped his very vitals
and froze his blood&mdash;he looked upon the scene
about him with horror and disgust. Indeed, it
was only by dint of self-control that he could be
civil to his host.</p>

<p>His fellow-guests were of divers types: a
couple of peers and their womenkind, a popular
actor-manager, two diplomats, and several military
men of more or less note&mdash;two of them,
like the host, occupying high positions at the
War Office.</p>

<p>Such gatherings were of frequent occurrence
at Hill Street. It was popularly supposed that
Sir Hugh, by marrying His Majesty's Minister's
widow, had married money, and was thus able
to sustain the position he did. Other military
men in his position found it difficult to make
both ends meet, and many envied old Hugh Elcombe
and his wealthy wife. They were unaware
that Lady Orlebar, after the settlement of her
husband's estate, had found herself with practically
nothing, and that her marriage to Sir
Hugh had been more to secure a home than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>thing
else. Both had, alas! been equally deceived.
The general, believing her to be rich, had
been sadly disillusioned; while she, on her part,
was equally filled with alarm when he revealed to
her his penurious position.</p>

<p>The world, of course, knew nothing of this.
Sir Hugh, ever since his re-marriage, had given
good dinners and had been entertained in return,
therefore everybody believed that he derived his
unusually large income from his wife.</p>

<p>As he sat at table he laughed and chatted
merrily with his guests, for on such occasions he
was always good company. Different, indeed,
was his attitude from when, at noon, he had stood
with Weirmarsh in his own den and pronounced
his own fate.</p>

<p>The man who held him in that strange thraldom
was seated at the table. He had been invited
three days ago, and had come there, perhaps,
to taunt him with his presence in those the
last few hours of his life.</p>

<p>Only once the two men exchanged glances,
for Weirmarsh was devoting all his attention to
young Lady Stockbridge. But when Sir Hugh
encountered the doctor's gaze he saw in his eyes
open defiance and triumph.</p>

<p>In ignorance of the keen interest which the
doctor across the table felt in him, Walter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
Fetherston sat chatting and laughing with Enid.
Once the doctor, to whom he had been introduced
only half an hour before, addressed a remark
to him to which he replied, at the same time reflecting
within himself that Weirmarsh was quite
a pleasant acquaintance.</p>

<p>He was unaware of that mysterious visit of
inquiry to Monifieth, of that remarkable cipher
telegram afterwards dispatched to Brussels, or
even of the extraordinary influence that man in
the well-worn evening suit possessed over both his
host and the handsome girl beside him.</p>

<p>When the ladies had left the table the doctor
set himself out over the cigarettes to become
more friendly with the writer of fiction. Then
afterwards he rose, and encountering his host,
who had also risen and crossed the room,
whispered in a voice of command: "You have
reconsidered your decision! You will commit
no foolish and cowardly act? I see it in your
face. I shall call to-morrow at noon, and we will
discuss the matter further."</p>

<p>The general did not reply for a few seconds.
But Weirmarsh had already realised that reflection
had brought his victim to a calmer state of
mind.</p>

<p>"I will not listen to you," the old man
growled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
"But I shall speak whether you listen or not.
Remember, I am not a man to be fooled by talk.
I shall be here at noon and lay before you a
scheme perhaps a little more practicable than the
last one." And with that he reached for some
matches, turned upon his heel, and rejoined the
man against whom he had warned Enid&mdash;the
only man in the world whom he feared.</p>

<p>Before they rose Weirmarsh had ingratiated
himself with his enemy. So clever was he that
Fetherston, in ignorance as to whom his fellow-guest
really was, save that he was a member of
the medical profession, was actually congratulating
himself that he had now met a man after his
own heart.</p>

<p>At last they repaired to the pretty old-rose-and-gold
drawing-room upstairs, an apartment
in which great taste was displayed in decoration,
and there several of the ladies sang or recited.
One of them, a vivacious young Frenchwoman,
was induced to give Barrois's romance, "J'ai vu
fleurir notre dernier lilas!"</p>

<p>When she had concluded Enid, with whom
Walter was seated, rose and passed into the small
conservatory, which was prettily illuminated with
fairy lights. As soon as they were alone she
turned to him in eager distress, saying: "Walter,
do, I beg of you, beware of that man!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
"Of what man?" he asked in quick surprise.</p>

<p>"Of Doctor Weirmarsh."</p>

<p>"Why? I don't know him. I never met him
until to-night. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"My stepfather's friend, but my enemy&mdash;and
yours," she cried quickly, placing her hand
upon her heart as though to quell its throbbing.</p>

<p>"Is he well known?" inquired the novelist.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;only in Pimlico. He lives in Vauxhall
Bridge Road, and his practice lies within
a radius of half a mile of Victoria Station."</p>

<p>"And why is he my enemy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that I cannot tell."</p>

<p>"Why is he your stepfather's friend?" asked
Fetherston. "They certainly seem to be on very
good terms."</p>

<p>"Doctor Weirmarsh's cunning and ingenuity
are unequalled," she declared. "Over me, as
over Sir Hugh, he has cast a kind of spell&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her companion laughed. "My dear Enid,"
he said, "spells are fictions of the past; nobody
believes in them nowadays. He may possess
some influence over you, but surely you are sufficiently
strong-minded to resist his power, whatever
it may be?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "I am not. For that
reason I fear for myself&mdash;and for Sir Hugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
That man compelled Sir Hugh to take me to
him for a consultation, and as soon as I was in
his presence I knew that his will was mine&mdash;that
I was powerless."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Fetherston,
much interested in this latest psychic problem.</p>

<p>"Neither do I understand myself," she answered
in bewilderment. "To me this man's
power, fascination&mdash;whatever you may term it&mdash;is
a complete mystery."</p>

<p>"I will investigate it," said Fetherston
promptly. "What is his address?"</p>

<p>She told him, and he scribbled it upon his
shirt-cuff. Then, looking into her beautiful countenance,
he asked: "Have you no idea of the
nature of this man's influence over Sir Hugh?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. It is plain, however, that
he is master over my stepfather's actions. My
mother has often remarked to me upon it," was
her response. "He comes here constantly, and
remains for hours closeted with Sir Hugh in his
study. So great is his influence that he orders
our servants to do his bidding."</p>

<p>"And he compelled Sir Hugh to take you
to his consulting room, eh? Under what pretext?"</p>

<p>"I was suffering from extreme nervousness,
and he prescribed for me with beneficial effect,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
she said. "But ever since I have felt myself
beneath his influence in a manner which I am
utterly unable to describe. I do not believe in
hypnotic suggestion, or it might be put down to
that."</p>

<p>"But what is your theory?"</p>

<p>"I have none, except&mdash;well, except that this
man, essentially a man of evil, possesses some
occult influence which other men do not possess."</p>

<p>"Yours is not a weak nature, Enid," he declared.
"You are not the sort of girl to fall beneath
the influence of another."</p>

<p>"I think not," she laughed in reply. "And
yet the truth is a hard and bitter one."</p>

<p>"Remain firm and determined to be mistress
of your own actions," he urged, "and in the
meantime I will cultivate the doctor's acquaintance
and endeavour to investigate the cause of
this remarkable influence of his."</p>

<p>Why did Doctor Weirmarsh possess such
power over Sir Hugh? he wondered. Could it
be that this man was actually in possession of
the truth? Was he aware of that same terrible
and hideous secret of which he himself was aware&mdash;a
secret which, if exposed, would convulse the
whole country, so shameful and scandalous
was it!</p>

<p>He saw how pale and agitated Enid was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
She had in her frantic anxiety sought his aid.
Only a few days ago they had parted; yet now,
in the moment of her fear and apprehension, she
had recalled him to her side to seek his advice
and protection.</p>

<p>She had not told him of that mysterious
warning Weirmarsh had given her concerning
him, or of his accurate knowledge of their acquaintanceship.
She had purposely refrained
from telling him this lest her words should unduly
prejudice him. She had warned Walter that
the doctor was his enemy&mdash;this, surely, was
sufficient!</p>

<p>"Try and discover, if you can, the reason of
the doctor's power over my father, and why he
is for ever directing his actions," urged the girl.
"For myself I care little; it is for Sir Hugh's
sake that I am trying to break the bonds, if
possible."</p>

<p>"You have no suspicion of the reason?" he
repeated, looking seriously into her face. "You
do not think that he holds some secret of your
stepfather's? Undue influence can frequently
be traced to such a source."</p>

<p>She shook her head in the negative, a blank
look in her great, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "it is all a mystery&mdash;one
which I beg of you, Walter, to solve, and"&mdash;she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
faltered in a strange voice&mdash;"and to save me!"</p>

<p>He pressed her hand and gave her his
promise. Then for a second she raised her full
red lips to his, and together they passed back into
the drawing-room, where their re-entry in company
did not escape the sharp eyes of the lonely
doctor of Pimlico.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h4>BENEATH THE ELASTIC BAND</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Walter Fetherston</span> strolled back that night to
the dingy chambers he rented in Holles Street,
off Oxford Street, as a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> when in London.
He was full of apprehension, full of curiosity,
as to who this Doctor Weirmarsh could be.</p>

<p>He entered his darkling, shabby old third-floor
room and threw himself into the arm-chair
before the fire to think. It was a room without
beauty, merely walls, repapered once every
twenty years, and furniture of the mid-Victorian
era. The mantelshelf in the bedroom still bore
stains from the medicine bottles which consoled
the final hours of the last tenant, a man about
whom a curious story was told.</p>

<p>It seems that he found a West End anchorage
there, not when he had retired, but when he
was in the very prime of life. He never told
anyone that he was single; at the same time he
never told anyone he was married. He just came
and rented those three rooms, and there his man
brought him his tea at ten o'clock every morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
for thirty years. Then he dressed himself and
went round to the Devonshire, in St. James's
Street, and there remained till closing time, at
two o'clock, every morning for thirty years.
When his club closed in the dog-days for repairs
he went to the club which received him.
He never went out of town. He never slept a
night away. He never had a visitor. He never
received a letter, and, so far as his man was
aware, never wrote one.</p>

<p>One morning he did not go through his usual
programme. The doctor was called, but during
the next fortnight he died.</p>

<p>Within twelve hours, however, his widow and
a family of grown-up children arrived, pleasant,
cheerful, inquisitive people, who took away with
them everything portable, greatly to the chagrin
of the devoted old manservant who had been the
tenant's single home-tie for thirty years.</p>

<p>It was these selfsame, dull, monotonous chambers
which Walter occupied. The old manservant
was the selfsame man who had so devotedly
served the previous tenant. They suited
Walter's purpose, for he was seldom in London,
so old Hayden had the place to himself for many
months every year. Of all the inhabitants of
London chambers those are the most lonely who
never wander away from London. But Walter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
was ever wandering, therefore he never noticed
the shabbiness of the carpet, the dinginess of
the furniture, or the dispiriting gloom of everything.</p>

<p>Like the previous tenant, Walter had no
visitors and was mostly out all day. At evening
he would write at the dusty old bureau in which
the late tenant had kept locked his family treasures,
or sit in the deep, old horsehair-covered
chair with his feet upon the fender, as he did that
night after returning from Hill Street.</p>

<p>The only innovation in those grimy rooms
was a good-sized fireproof safe which stood in the
corner hidden by a side-table, and from this Walter
had taken a bundle of papers and carried
them with him to his chair.</p>

<p>One by one he carefully went through them,
until at last he found the document of which he
was in search.</p>

<p>"Yes," he exclaimed to himself after he had
scanned it, "so I was not mistaken after all!
The mystery is deeper than I thought. By Jove!
that fellow, Joseph Blot, alias Weirmarsh, alias
Detmold, Ponting and half a dozen other names,
no doubt, is playing a deep game&mdash;a dangerous
customer evidently!"</p>

<p>Then, again returning to the safe, he took
out a large packet of miscellaneous photographs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
of various persons secured by an elastic band.
These he went rapidly through until he held one
in his hand, an unmounted <i>carte-de-visite</i>, which
he examined closely beneath the green-shaded
reading-lamp.</p>

<p>It was a portrait of Doctor Weirmarsh, evidently
taken a few years before, as he then wore
a short pointed beard, whereas he was now shaven
except for a moustache.</p>

<p>"No mistake about those features," he remarked
to himself with evident satisfaction as,
turning the photographic print, he took note of
certain cabalistic numbers written in the corner,
scribbling them in pencil upon his blotting-pad.</p>

<p>"I thought I recollected those curious eyes
and that unusual breadth of forehead," he went
on, speaking to himself, and again examining the
pictured face through his gold pince-nez. "It's
a long time since I looked at this photograph&mdash;fully
five years. What would the amiable doctor
think if he knew that I held the key which
will unlock his past?"</p>

<p>He laughed lightly to himself, and, selecting
a cigarette from the silver box, lit it.</p>

<p>Then he sat back in his big arm-chair, his
eyes fixed upon the fire, contemplating what he
realised to be a most exciting and complicated
problem.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
"This means that I must soon be upon the
move again," he murmured to himself. "Enid
has sought my assistance&mdash;she has asked me to
save her, and I will exert my utmost endeavour
to do so. But I see it will be difficult, very difficult.
She is, no doubt, utterly unaware of the
real identity of this brisk, hard-working doctor.
And perhaps, after all," he added slowly, "it is
best so&mdash;best that she remain in ignorance of this
hideous, ghastly truth!"</p>

<p>At that same moment, while Walter Fetherston
was preoccupied by these curious apprehensions,
the original of that old <i>carte-de-visite</i> was
seated in the lounge of the Savoy Hotel, smoking
a cigar with a tall, broad-shouldered, red-bearded
man who was evidently a foreigner.</p>

<p>He had left Hill Street five minutes after
Fetherston, and driven down to the Savoy, where
he had a rendezvous for supper with his friend.
That he was an habitu&eacute; there was patent from
the fact that upon entering the restaurant, Alphonse,
the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, with his plan of the
tables pinned upon the board, greeted him with,
"Ah! good evening, Docteur. Table vingt-six,
Docteur Weirmarsh."</p>

<p>The scene was the same as it is every evening
at the Savoy; the music, the smart dresses of the
women, the flowers, the shaded lights, the chatter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
and the irresponsible laughter of the London
world amusing itself after the stress of war.</p>

<p>You know it&mdash;why, therefore, should I describe
it? Providing you possess an evening suit
or a low-necked dress, you can always rub
shoulders with the <i>monde</i> and the <i>demi-monde</i> of
London at a cost of a few shillings a head.</p>

<p>The two men had supped and were chatting
in French over their coffee and "triplesec."
Gustav, Weirmarsh called his friend, and from
his remarks it was apparent that he was a stranger
to London. He was dressed with elegance.
Upon the corner of his white lawn handkerchief
a count's coronet was embroidered, and upon his
cigar-case also was a coronet and a cipher. In
his dress-shirt he wore a fine diamond, while upon
the little finger of his left hand glittered a similar
stone of great lustre.</p>

<p>The lights were half extinguished, and a
porter's voice cried, "Time's up, ladies and gentlemen!"
Those who were not habitu&eacute;s rose
and commenced to file out, but the men and
women who came to the restaurant each night
sat undisturbed till the lights went up again
and another ten minutes elapsed before the final
request to leave was made.</p>

<p>The pair, seated away in a corner, had been
chatting in an undertone when they were com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>pelled
to rise. Thereupon the doctor insisted
that his friend, whose name was Gustav Heureux,
should accompany him home. So twenty minutes
later they alighted from a taxi-cab in the Vauxhall
Bridge Road, and entered the shabby little
room wherein Weirmarsh schemed and
plotted.</p>

<p>The doctor produced from a cupboard some
cognac and soda and a couple of glasses, and
when they had lit cigars they sat down to resume
their chat.</p>

<p>Alone there, the doctor spoke in English.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "it is a matter of
the greatest importance&mdash;if we make this coup
we can easily make a hundred thousand pounds
within a fortnight. The general at first refused
and became a trifle&mdash;well, just a trifle resentful,
even vindictive; but by showing a bold front I've
brought him round. To-morrow I shall clinch
the matter. That is my intention."</p>

<p>"It will be a brilliant snap, if you can actually
accomplish it," was the red-bearded man's enthusiastic
reply. He now spoke in English, but
with a strong American accent. "I made an
attempt two years ago, but failed, and narrowly
escaped imprisonment."</p>

<p>"A dozen attempts have already been made,
but all in vain," replied the doctor, drawing hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
at his cigar. "Therefore, I'm all the more keen
to secure success."</p>

<p>"You certainly have been very successful
over here, Doctor," observed the foreigner, whose
English had been acquired in America. "We
have heard of you in New York, where you are
upheld to us as a model. Jensen once told me
that your methods were so ingenious as to be
unassailable."</p>

<p>"Merely because I am well supplied with
funds," answered the other with modesty.
"Here, in England, as elsewhere, any man or
woman can be bought&mdash;if you pay their price.
There is only one section of the wonderful British
public who cannot be purchased&mdash;the men and
women who are in love with each other. Whenever
I come up against Cupid, experience has
taught me to retire deferentially, and wait until
the love-fever has abated. It often turns to jealousy
or hatred, and then the victims fall as
easily as off a log. A jealous woman will betray
any secret, even though it may hurry her lover
to his grave. To me, my dear Gustav, this
fevered world of London is all very amusing."</p>

<p>"And your profession as doctor must serve
as a most excellent mask. Who would suspect
you&mdash;a lonely bachelor in such quarters as
these?" exclaimed his visitor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
"No one does suspect me," laughed the doctor
with assurance. "Safety lies in pursuing my increasing
practice, and devoting all my spare time
to&mdash;well, to my real profession." He flicked the
ash off his cigar as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Your friend, Elcombe, will have to be very
careful. The peril is considerable in that
quarter."</p>

<p>"I know that full well. But if he failed it
would be he who would suffer&mdash;not I. As usual,
I do not appear in the affair at all."</p>

<p>"That is just where you are so intensely
clever and ingenious," declared Heureux. "In
New York they speak of you as a perfect marvel
of foresight and clever evasion."</p>

<p>"It is simply a matter of exercising one's
wits," Weirmarsh laughed lightly. "I always
complete my plans with great care before embarking
upon them, and I make provision for
every contretemps possible. It is the only way,
if one desires success."</p>

<p>"And you have had success," remarked his
companion. "Marked success in everything you
have attempted. In New York we have not been
nearly so fortunate. Those three articles in the
<i>New York Sun</i> put the public on their guard, so
that we dare not attempt any really bold move
for fear of detection."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
"You have worked a little too openly, I
think," was Weirmarsh's reply. "But now that
you have been sent to assist me, you will probably
see that my methods differ somewhat from
those of John Willoughby. Remember, he has
just the same amount of money placed at his disposal
as I have."</p>

<p>"And he is not nearly so successful," Heureux
replied. "Perhaps it is because Americans
are not so easily befooled as the English."</p>

<p>"And yet America is, <i>par excellence</i>, the
country of bluff, of quackery in patent medicines,
and of the booming of unworthy persons," the
doctor laughed.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate, Doctor, that the public are
in ignorance of the real nature of our work, isn't
it, eh? Otherwise, you and I might experience
rather rough handling if this house were
mobbed."</p>

<p>Weirmarsh smiled grimly. "My dear Gustav,"
he laughed, "the British public, though of
late they've browsed upon the hysterics of the
popular Press, are already asleep again. It is
not for us to arouse them. We profit by their
heavy slumber, and this will be a rude awakening&mdash;a
shock, depend upon it."</p>

<p>"We were speaking of Sir Hugh Elcombe,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
remarked the other. "He has been of use to
us, eh?"</p>

<p>"Of considerable use, but his usefulness is
all but ended," replied the doctor. "He will go
to France before long, if he does not act as I
direct."</p>

<p>"Into a veritable hornet's nest!" exclaimed
the red-bearded man. He recognised a strange
expression upon the doctor's face, and added,
"Ah, I see. This move is intentional, eh? He
has served our purpose, and you now deem it
wise that&mdash;er&mdash;disaster should befall him across
the Channel, eh?"</p>

<p>The doctor smiled in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"And the girl you spoke of, Enid Orlebar?"</p>

<p>"The girl will share the same fate as her stepfather,"
was Weirmarsh's hard response. "We
cannot risk betrayal."</p>

<p>"Then she knows something?"</p>

<p>"She may or she may not. In any case, however,
she constitutes a danger, a grave danger,
that must, at all costs, be removed." And looking
into the other's face, he added, "You understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>Just before two o'clock Gustav Heureux left
the frowsy house in Vauxhall Bridge Road and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
walked through the silent street into Victoria
Street.</p>

<p>He was unaware, however, that on the opposite
side of the road an ill-dressed man had for a
full hour been lurking in a doorway, or that when
he came down the doctor's steps, the mysterious
midnight watcher strolled noiselessly after him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h4>CONCERNING THE VELVET HAND</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the rising ground half-way between Wimborne
and Poole, in Dorsetshire, up a narrow by-road
which leads to the beautiful woods, lies the
tiny hamlet of Idsworth, a secluded little place
of about forty inhabitants, extremely rural and
extremely picturesque.</p>

<p>Standing alone half-way up the hill, and surrounded
by trees, was an old-world thatched cottage,
half-timbered, with high, red-brick chimneys,
quaint gables and tiny dormer windows&mdash;a
delightful old Elizabethan house with a comfortable,
homely look. Behind it a well-kept
flower garden, with a tree-fringed meadow beyond,
while the well-rolled gravelled walks, the
rustic fencing, and the pretty curtains at the casements
betrayed the fact that the rustic homestead
was not the residence of a villager.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it belonged to a Mr. John
Maltwood, a bachelor, whom Idsworth believed
to be in business in London, and who came there
at intervals for fresh air and rest. His visits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
were not very frequent. Sometimes he would be
absent for many months, and at others he would
remain there for weeks at a time, with a cheery
word always for the labourers on their way home
from work, and always with his hand in his pocket
in the cause of charity.</p>

<p>John Maltwood, the quiet, youngish-looking
man in the gold pince-nez, was popular everywhere
over the country-side. He did not court
the society of the local parsons and their wives,
nor did he return any of the calls made upon
him. His excuse was that he was at Idsworth
for rest, and not for social duties. This very independence
of his endeared him to the villagers,
who always spoke of him as "one of the right
sort."</p>

<p>At noon on the day following the dinner at
Hill Street, Walter Fetherston&mdash;known at Idsworth
as Mr. Maltwood&mdash;alighted from the station
fly, and was met at the cottage gate by the
smiling, pleasant-faced woman in a clean apron
who acted as caretaker.</p>

<p>He divested himself of his overcoat in the
tiny entrance-hall, passed into a small room, with
the great open hearth, where in days long ago the
bacon was smoked, and along a passage into the
long, old-world dining-room, with its low ceiling
with great dark beams, its solemn-ticking, brass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>-faced
grandfather clock, and its profusion of old
blue china.</p>

<p>There he gave some orders to Mrs. Deacon,
obtained a cigarette, and passed back along the
passage to a small, cosy, panelled room at the
end of the house&mdash;the room wherein he wrote
those mystery stories which held the world enthralled.</p>

<p>It was a pretty, restful place, with a moss-green
carpet, green-covered chairs, several cases
filled to overflowing with books, and a great
writing-table set in the window. On the mantelshelf
were many autographed portraits of Continental
celebrities, while on the walls were one
or two little gems of antique art which he had
picked up on his erratic wanderings. Over the
writing-table was a barometer and a storm-glass,
while to the left a cosy corner extended round
to the fireplace.</p>

<p>He lit his cigarette, then walking across to a
small square oaken door let into the wall beside
the fireplace, he opened it with a key. This had
been an oven before the transformation of three
cottages into a week-end residence, and on opening
it there was displayed the dark-green door of
a safe. This he quickly opened with another key,
and after slight search took out a small ledger
covered with dark-red leather.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
Then glancing at some numerals upon a piece
of paper he took from his vest pocket, he turned
them up in the index, and with another volume
open upon his blotting-pad, he settled himself to
read the record written there in a small, round
hand. The numbers were those upon the back of
the old <i>carte-de-visite</i> which had interested him so
keenly, and the statement he was reading was,
from the expression upon his countenance, an
amazing one.</p>

<p>From time to time he scribbled memoranda
upon the scrap of paper, now and then pausing
as though to recall the past. Then, when he had
finished, he laughed softly to himself, and, closing
the book, replaced it in the safe and shut the
oaken door. By the inspection of that secret
entry he had learnt much regarding that man who
posed as a doctor in Pimlico.</p>

<p>He sat back in his writing-chair and puffed
thoughtfully at his cigarette. Then he turned his
attention to a pile of letters addressed to him as
"Mr. Maltwood," and made some scribbled replies
until Mrs. Deacon entered to announce that
his luncheon was ready.</p>

<p>When he went back to the quaint, old-fashioned
dining-room and seated himself, he said:
"I'm going back by the five-eighteen, and I dare
say I shan't return for quite a month or perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
six weeks. Here's a cheque for ten pounds to
pay these little bills." And he commenced his
solitary meal.</p>

<p>"You haven't been here much this summer,
sir," remarked the good woman. "In Idsworth
they think you've quite deserted us&mdash;Mr. Barnes
was only saying so last week. They're all so glad
to see you down here, sir."</p>

<p>"That's very good of them, Mrs. Deacon,"
he laughed. "I, too, only wish I could spend
more time here. I love the country, and I'm
never so happy as when wandering in Idsworth
woods."</p>

<p>And then he asked her to tell him the village
gossip while she waited at his table.</p>

<p>After luncheon he put on a rough suit and,
taking his stout holly stick, went for a ramble
through the great woods he loved so well, where
the trees were tinted by autumn and the pheasants
were strong upon the wing.</p>

<p>He found Findlay, one of the keepers, and
walked with him for an hour as far as the Roman
camp, where alone he sat down upon a felled
tree and, with his gaze fixed across the distant
hills towards the sea, pondered deeply. He loved
his modest country cottage, and he loved those
quiet, homely Dorsetshire folk around him. Yet
such a wanderer was he that only a few months<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
each year&mdash;the months he wrote those wonderful
romances of his&mdash;could he spend in that old-fashioned
cottage which he had rendered the very
acme of cosiness and comfort.</p>

<p>At half-past four the rickety station fly called
for him, and later he left by the express which
took him to Waterloo and his club in time for
dinner.</p>

<p>And so once again he changed his identity
from John Maltwood, busy man of business, to
Walter Fetherston, novelist and traveller.</p>

<p>The seriousness of what was in progress was
now plain to him. He had long been filled with
strong suspicions, and these suspicions had been
confirmed both by Enid's statements and his own
observations; therefore he was already alert and
watchful.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he went to his gloomy chambers
for an hour, and then strolled forth to the
Vauxhall Bridge Road, and remained vigilant
outside the doctor's house until nearly two.</p>

<p>He noted those who came and went&mdash;two men
who called before midnight, and were evidently
foreigners. They came separately, remained
about half an hour, and then Weirmarsh himself
let them out, shaking hands with them effusively.</p>

<p>Suddenly a taxicab drove up, and from it
Sir Hugh, in black overcoat and opera hat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
stepped out and was at once admitted, the taxi
driving off. Walter, as he paced up and down
the pavement outside, would have given much
to know what was transpiring within.</p>

<p>Had he been able to glance inside that shabby
little back room he would have witnessed a
strange scene&mdash;Sir Hugh, the gallant old soldier,
crushed and humiliated by the man who practised
medicine, and who called himself Weirmarsh.</p>

<p>"I had only just come in from the theatre
when you telephoned me," Sir Hugh said sharply
on entering. "I am sorry I could make no appointment
to-day, but I was at the War Office
all the morning, lunched at the Carlton, and was
afterwards quite full up."</p>

<p>"There was no immediate hurry, Sir Hugh,"
responded the doctor with a pleasant smile. "I
quite understand that your many social engagements
prevented you from seeing me. I should
have been round at noon, only I was called out
to an urgent case. Therefore no apology is
needed&mdash;by either of us." Then, after a pause,
he looked sharply at the man seated before him
and asked: "I presume you have reconsidered
your decision, General, and will carry out my
request?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not decided to do that," was the
old fellow's firm answer. "It's too dangerous an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
exploit&mdash;far too dangerous. Besides, it means
ruin."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," remarked the doctor, "you
are viewing the matter in quite a wrong light.
There will be no suspicion providing you exercise
due caution."</p>

<p>"And what would be the use of that, pray,
when my secret will not be mine alone? It is
already known to half a dozen other persons&mdash;your
friends&mdash;any of whom might give me away."</p>

<p>"It will not be known until afterwards&mdash;when
you are safe. Therefore, there will be absolutely
no risk," the doctor assured him.</p>

<p>The other, however, was no fool, and was still
unconvinced. He knew well that to carry out
the request made by Weirmarsh involved considerable
risk.</p>

<p>The doctor spoke quietly, but very firmly.
In his demands he was always inexorable. He
had already hinted at the disaster which might
fall upon Sir Hugh if he refused to obey. Weirmarsh
was, the general knew from bitter experience,
not a man to be trifled with.</p>

<p>Completely and irrevocably he was in this
man's hands. During the past twenty-four hours
the grave old fellow, who had faced death a hundred
times, had passed through a crisis of agony
and despair. He hated himself, and would even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
have welcomed death, would have courted it at
his own hands, had not these jeers of the doctor's
rung in his ears. And, after all, he had decided
that suicide was only a coward's death. The man
who takes his own life to avoid exposure is always
despised by his friends.</p>

<p>So he had lived, and had come down there in
response to the doctor's request over the telephone,
resolved to face the music, if for the last
time.</p>

<p>He sat in the shabby old arm-chair and firmly
refused to carry out the doctor's suggestion. But
Weirmarsh, with his innate cunning, presented to
him a picture of exposure and degradation which
held him horrified.</p>

<p>"I should have thought, Sir Hugh, that in
face of what must inevitably result you would
not risk exposure," he said. "Of course, it lies
with you entirely," he added with an unconcerned
air.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of my family," the old officer
said slowly.</p>

<p>"Of the disgrace if the truth were known,
eh?"</p>

<p>"No; of the suspicion, nay, ruin and imprisonment,
that would fall upon another person,"
replied Sir Hugh.</p>

<p>"No suspicion can be aroused if you are care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>ful,
I repeat," exclaimed Weirmarsh impatiently.
"Not a breath of suspicion has ever fallen upon
you up to the present, has it? No, because you
have exercised foresight and have followed to
the letter the plans I made. I ask you, when you
have followed my advice have you ever gone
wrong&mdash;have you ever taken one false step?"</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;since the first," replied the old
soldier in a hard, bitter tone.</p>

<p>"Then I urge you to continue to follow the
advice I give you, namely, to agree to the terms."</p>

<p>"And who will be aware of the matter?"</p>

<p>"Only myself," was Weirmarsh's reply.
"And I think that you may trust a secret with
me?"</p>

<p>The old man made no reply, and the crafty
doctor wondered whether by silence he very reluctantly
gave his consent.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h4>PAUL LE PONTOIS</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is in the far north-west of France a broad,
white highway which runs from Ch&acirc;lons, crosses
the green Meuse valley, mounts the steep, high,
tree-fringed lands of the C&ocirc;tes Lorraines, and
goes almost straight as an arrow across what
was, before the war, the German frontier at
Mars-la-Tour into quaint old Metz, that town
with ancient streets, musical chimes, and sad
monument to Frenchmen who fell in the disastrous
never-to-be-forgotten war of '70.</p>

<p>This road has ever been one of the most
strongly guarded highways in the world, for,
between the Moselle, at Metz, and the Meuse, the
country is a flat plain smiling under cultivation,
with vines and cornfields everywhere, and comfortable
little homesteads of the peasantry. This
was once the great battlefield whereon Gravelotte
was fought long ago, and where the Prussians
swept back the French like chaff before the wind,
and where France, later on, defeated the Crown
Prince's army. The peasants, in ploughing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
daily turn up a rusty bayonet, a rotting gun-stock,
a skull, a thigh-bone, or some other hideous
relic of those black days; while the old men in
their blouses sit of nights smoking and telling
thrilling stories of the ferocity of that helmeted
enemy from yonder across the winding Moselle.
In recent days it has been again devastated by
the great world war, as its gaunt ruins mutely
tell.</p>

<p>That road, with its long line of poplars, after
crossing the ante-war French border, runs
straight for twenty kilom&egrave;tres towards the abrupt
range of high hills which form the natural
frontier of France, and then, at Haudiomont, enters
a narrow pass, over twelve kilom&egrave;tres long,
before it reaches the broad valley of the Meuse.
This pass was, before 1914, one of the four principal
gateways into France from Germany. The
others are all within a short distance, fifteen kilom&egrave;tres
or so&mdash;at Commercy, which is an important
sous-prefecture, at Apremont, and at Eix.
All have ever been strongly guarded, but that at
Haudiomont was most impregnable of them all.</p>

<p>Before 1914 great forts in which were
mounted the most modern and the most destructive
artillery ever devised by man, commanded
the whole country far beyond the Moselle into
Germany. Every hill-top bristled with them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
smaller batteries were in every coign of vantage,
while those narrow mountain passes could also be
closed at any moment by being blown up when
the signal was given against the Hun invaders.</p>

<p>On the German side were many fortresses, but
none was so strong as these, for the efforts of the
French Ministry of War had, ever since the fall
of Napoleon III., been directed towards rendering
the C&ocirc;tes Lorraines impassable.</p>

<p>As one stands upon the road outside the tiny
hamlet of Harville&mdash;a quaint but half-destroyed
little place consisting of one long street of ruined
whitewashed houses&mdash;and looks towards the hills
eastward, low concrete walls can be seen, half
hidden, but speaking mutely of the withering
storm of shell that had, in 1914, burst from them
and swept the land.</p>

<p>Much can be seen of that chain of damaged
fortresses, and the details of most of them are now
known. Of those great ugly fortifications at
Moulainville&mdash;the Belrupt Fort, which overlooks
the Meuse; the Daumaumont, commanding the
road from Conflans to Azannes; the Paroches,
which stands directly over the highway from the
Moselle at Moussin&mdash;we have heard valiant
stories, how the brave French defended them
against the armies of the Crown Prince.</p>

<p>It was not upon these, however, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
French Army relied when, in August, 1914, the
clash of war resounded along that pleasant fertile
valley, where the sun seems ever to shine and
the crops never fail. Hidden away from the
sight of passers-by upon the roads, protected
from sight by lines of sentries night and day, and
unapproachable, save by those immediately connected
with them, were the secret defences, huge
forts with long-range ordnance, which rose, fired,
and disappeared again, offering no mark for the
enemy. Constructed in strictest secrecy, there
were a dozen of such fortresses, the true details
of which the Huns vainly endeavoured to learn
while they were war-plotting. Many a spy of the
Kaiser had tried to pry there and had been arrested
and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Those defences, placed at intervals along the
chain of hills right from Apremont away to
Bezonvaux, had been the greatest secret which
France possessed.</p>

<p>Within three kilom&egrave;tres of the mouth of the
pass at Haudiomont, at a short distance from the
road and at the edge of a wood, stood the ancient
Ch&acirc;teau de L&eacute;rouville, a small picturesque place
of the days of Louis XIV., with pretty lawns
and old-world gardens&mdash;a ch&acirc;teau only in the
sense of being a country house and the residence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
of Paul Le Pontois, once a captain in the French
Army, but now retired.</p>

<p>Shut off from the road by a high old wall,
with great iron gates, it was approached by a
wide carriage-drive through a well-kept flower-garden
to a long <i>terrasse</i> which ran the whole
length of the house, and whereon, in summer, it
was the habit of the family to take their meals.</p>

<p>Upon this veranda, one morning about ten
days after the dinner party at Hill Street, Sir
Hugh, in a suit of light grey tweed, was standing
chatting with his son-in-law, a tall, brown-bearded,
soldierly-looking man.</p>

<p>The autumn sun shone brightly over the rich
vinelands, beyond which stretched what was once
the German Empire.</p>

<p>Madame Le Pontois, a slim, dark-eyed, good-looking
woman of thirty, was still at table in the
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>, finishing her breakfast in the
English style with little Ninette, a pretty blue-eyed
child of nine, whose hair was tied on the
top with wide white ribbon, and who spoke English
quite well.</p>

<p>Her husband and her father had gone out
upon the <i>terrasse</i> to have their cigarettes prior to
their walk up the steep hillside to the fortress.</p>

<p>Life in that rural district possessed few
amusements outside the military circle, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
Paul Le Pontois was a civilian and lived upon
the product of the wine-lands of his estate.
There were tennis parties, "fif' o'clocks," croquet
and bridge-playing in the various military houses
around, but beyond that&mdash;nothing. They were
too far from a big town ever to go there for recreation.
Metz they seldom went to, and with Paris
far off, Madame Le Pontois was quite content,
just as she had been when Paul had been stationed
in stifling Constantine, away in the interior
of Algeria.</p>

<p>But she never complained. Devoted to her
husband and to her laughing, bright-eyed child,
she loved the open-air life of the country, and
with such a commodious and picturesque house,
one of the best in the district, she thoroughly
enjoyed every hour of her life. Paul possessed
a private income of fifty thousand francs, or
nearly two thousand pounds a year, therefore
he was better off than the average run of post-war
men.</p>

<p>He was a handsome, distinguished-looking
man. As he lolled against the railing of the
<i>terrasse</i>, gay with ivy-leaf geraniums, lazily
smoking his cigarette and laughing lightly with
his father-in-law, he presented a typical picture
of the debonair Frenchman of the boulevards&mdash;elegance
combined with soldierly smartness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
He had seen service in Tonquin, in Algeria,
on the French Congo and in the Argonne, and
now his old company garrisoned Haudiomont,
one of those forts of enormous strength, which
commanded the gate of France, and had never
been taken by the Crown Prince's army.</p>

<p>"No," he was laughing, speaking in good
English, "you in England, my dear beaup&egrave;re,
do not yet realise the dangers of the future.
Happily for you, perhaps, because you have the
barrier of the sea. Your writers used to speak
of your 'tight little island.' But I do not see
much of that in London journals now. Airships
and aeroplanes have altered all that."</p>

<p>"But you in France are always on the
alert?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. We have our new guns&mdash;terrible
weapons they are&mdash;at St. Mihiel and at Mouilly,
and also in other forts in what was once German
territory," was Paul's reply. "The Huns&mdash;who,
after peace, are preparing for another war, have
a Krupp gun for the same purpose, but at its
trial a few weeks ago at Pferzheim it was an utter
failure. A certain lieutenant was present at
the trial, disguised as a German peasant. He
saw it all, returned here, and made an exhaustive
report to Paris."</p>

<p>"You do not believe in this peace, and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
sincerity of the enemy, eh?" asked Sir Hugh,
with his hands thrust deep into his trousers
pockets.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was Paul's prompt reply.
"I am no longer in the army, but it seems to me
that to repair the damage done by the Kaiser's
freak performances in the international arena,
quite a number of national committees must be
constituted under the auspices of the German
Government. There are the Anglo-German, the
Austro-German, the American-German and the
Canadian-German committees, all to be formed
in their respective countries for the promotion of
friendship and better relations. But I tell you,
Sir Hugh, that we in France know well that the
imposing names at the head of these committees
are but too often on the secret pay-rolls of the
Wilhelmstrasse, and the honesty and sincerity of
the finely-worded manifestations of Hun friendship
and goodwill appearing above their signatures
are generally nothing but mere blinds intended
to hoodwink statesmen and public opinion.
Germany has, just as she had before the war,
her paid friends everywhere," he added, looking
the general full in the face. "In all classes of
society are to be found the secret agents of the
Fatherland&mdash;men who are base traitors to their
own monarch and to their own land."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
"Let us go in. They are waiting for us. We
are not interested in espionage, either of us, are
we?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Paul. "When I was in the
army we heard a lot of this, but all that is of the
past&mdash;thanks to Heaven. There are other crimes
in the world just as bad, alas! as that of treachery
to one's country."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h4>THE LITTLE OLD FRENCHWOMAN</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Sir Hugh had on frequent occasions
been the guest of his son-in-law at the pretty
Ch&acirc;teau de L&eacute;rouville, he had never expressed a
wish, until the previous evening, to enter the
Fortress of Haudiomont.</p>

<p>As a military man he knew well how zealously
the secrets of all fortresses are guarded.</p>

<p>When, on the previous evening, Le Pontois
had declared that it would be an easy matter for
him to be granted a view of that great stronghold
hidden away among the hill-tops, he had remarked:
"Of course, my dear Paul, I would not
for a moment dream of putting you into any awkward
position. Remember, I am an alien here,
and a soldier also! I haven't any desire to see
the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no question of that so far as you
are concerned, Sir Hugh," Paul had declared
with a light laugh. "The Commandant, who,
of course, knows you, asked me a month ago to
bring you up next time you visited us. He
wished to make your acquaintance. In view of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
the recent war our people are nowadays no longer
afraid of England, you know!"</p>

<p>So the visit had been arranged, and Sir Hugh
was to take his <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> up at the fort.</p>

<p>That day Blanche, with Enid, who had accompanied
her stepfather, drove the runabout
car up the valley to the little station at Dieue-sur-Meuse,
and took train thence to Commercy,
where Blanche wished to do some shopping.</p>

<p>So, when the two men had left to ascend the
steep hillside, where the great fortress lay concealed,
Blanche, who had by long residence in
France become almost a Frenchwoman, kissed
little Ninette <i>au revoir</i>, mounted into the car, and,
taking the wheel, drove Enid and Jean, the servant,
who, as a soldier, had served Paul during
the war, away along the winding valley.</p>

<p>As they went along they passed a battalion
of the 113th Regiment of the Line, heavy with
their knapsacks, their red trousers dusty, returning
from the long morning march, and singing
as they went that very old regimental ditty which
every soldier of France knows so well:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>La Noire est fille du cannon</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>Qui se fout du qu'en dira-t-on.</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>Nous nous foutons de ses vertus,</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>Puisqu'elle a les t&eacute;tons pointus.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Voil&agrave; pourquoi nous la chantons:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Vive la Noire et ses t&eacute;tons!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
And as they passed the ladies the officer saluted.
They were, Blanche explained, on their
way back to the great camp at Jarny.</p>

<p>Bugles were sounding among the hills, while
ever and anon came the low boom of distant artillery
at practice away in the direction of Vigneulles-les-Hattonchatel,
the headquarters of the
sub-division of that military region.</p>

<p>It was Enid's first visit, and the activity about
her surprised her. Besides, the officers were extremely
good-looking.</p>

<p>Presently they approached a battery of artillery
on the march, with their rumbling guns and
grey ammunition wagons, raising a cloud of dust
as they advanced.</p>

<p>Blanche pulled the car up at the side of the
road to allow them to pass, and as she did so a
tall, smartly-groomed major rode up to her, and,
saluting, exclaimed in French, "Bon jour,
Madame! I intended to call upon you this morning.
My wife has heard that you have the general,
your father, visiting you, and we wanted
to know if you would all come and take dinner
with us to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure we'd be most delighted," replied
Paul's wife, at the same time introducing Enid
to Major Delagrange.</p>

<p>"My father has gone up to the fort with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
my husband," Blanche added, bending over from
the car.</p>

<p>"Ah, then I shall meet them at noon," replied
the smart officer, backing his bay horse.
"And you ladies are going out for a run, eh?
Beautiful morning! We've been out man&#339;uvring
since six!"</p>

<p>Blanche explained that they were on a shopping
expedition to Commercy, and then, saluting,
Delagrange set spurs into his horse and galloped
away after the retreating battery.</p>

<p>"That man's wife is one of my best friends.
She speaks English very well, and is quite a good
sort. Delagrange and Paul were in Tonquin together
and are great friends."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are never very dull here, with
so much always going on?" Enid remarked.
"Why anyone would believe that a war was actually
in progress!"</p>

<p>"This post of Eastern France never sleeps,
my dear," was Madame's reply. "While you in
England remain secure in your island, we here
never know when trouble may again arise.
Therefore, we are always preparing&mdash;and at the
same time always prepared."</p>

<p>"It must be most exciting," declared the girl,
"to live in such uncertainty. Is the danger so
very real, then?" she asked. "Father generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
pooh-poohs the notion of there being any further
trouble with Germany."</p>

<p>"I know," was Blanche's answer. "He has
been sceptical hitherto. He is always suspicious
of the Boche!"</p>

<p>They had driven up to the little wayside station,
and, giving the car over to Jean with instructions
to meet the five-forty train, they entered
a first-class compartment.</p>

<p>Between Dieue and Commercy the railway
follows the course of the Meuse the whole way,
winding up a narrow, fertile valley, the hills of
which on the right, which once were swept by the
enemy's shells and completely devastated, were
all strongly fortified with great guns commanding
the plain that lies between the Meuse and the
Moselle.</p>

<p>They were passing through one of the most
interesting districts in all France&mdash;that quiet, fertile
valley where stood peaceful, prosperous
homesteads, and where the sheep were once more
calmly grazing&mdash;the valley which for four years
was so strongly contested, and where every village
had been more or less destroyed.</p>

<p>At the headquarters of the Sixth Army Corps
of France much was known, much that was still
alarming. It was that knowledge which urged
on those ever active military preparations, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
placing that district of France that had been ravaged
by the Hun in the Great War in a state of
complete fortification as a second line of defence
should trouble again arise.</p>

<p>Thoughts such as these arose in Enid's mind
as she sat in silence looking forth upon the panorama
of green hills and winding stream as they
slowly approached the quaint town of Commercy.</p>

<p>Arrived there, the pair lunched at the old-fashioned
H&ocirc;tel de Paris, under the shadow of
the great ch&acirc;teau, once the residence of the Dukes
de Lorraine, and much damaged in the war, but
nowadays a hive of activity as an infantry barracks.
And afterwards they went forth to do
their shopping in the busy little Rue de la R&eacute;publique,
not forgetting to buy a box of "madeleines."
As shortbread is the specialty of Edinburgh,
as butterscotch is that of Doncaster,
"maids-of-honour" that of Richmond, and
strawberry jam that of Bar-le-Duc, so are
"madeleines" the special cakes of Commercy.</p>

<p>The town was full of officers and soldiers. In
every caf&eacute; officers were smoking cigarettes and
gossiping after their <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>; while ever and
anon bugles sounded, and there was the clang and
clatter of military movement.</p>

<p>As the two ladies approached the big bronze
statue of Dom Calmet, the historian, they passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
a small caf&eacute;. Suddenly a man idling within over
a newspaper sprang to his feet in surprise, and
next second drew back as if in fear of observation.</p>

<p>It was Walter Fetherston. He had come up
from Nancy that morning, and had since occupied
the time in strolling about seeing the sights
of the little place.</p>

<p>His surprise at seeing Enid was very great.
He knew that she was staying in the vicinity, but
had never expected to see her so quickly.</p>

<p>The lady who accompanied her he guessed to
be her stepsister; indeed, he had seen a photograph
of her at Hill Street. Had Enid been
alone, he would have rushed forth to greet her;
but he had no desire at the moment that his presence
should be known to Madame Le Pontois.
He was there to watch, and to meet Enid&mdash;but
alone.</p>

<p>So after a few moments he cautiously went
forth from the caf&eacute;, and followed the two ladies
at a respectful distance, until he saw them complete
their purchases and afterwards enter the
station to return home.</p>

<p>On his return to the hotel he made many inquiries
of monsieur the proprietor concerning the
distance to Haudiomont, and learned a good
deal about the military works there which was of
the greatest interest. The hotel-keeper, a stout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
Alsatian, was a talkative person, and told Walter
nearly all he wished to know.</p>

<p>Since leaving Charing Cross five days before
he had been ever active. On his arrival in Paris
he had gone to the apartment of Colonel Maynard,
the British military attach&eacute;, and spent the
evening with him. Then, at one o'clock next
morning, he had hurriedly taken his bag and left
for Dijon, where at noon he had been met in the
Caf&eacute; de la Rotonde by a little wizen-faced old
Frenchwoman in seedy black, who had travelled
for two days and nights in order to meet him.</p>

<p>Together they had walked out on that unfrequented
road beyond the Place Darcy, chatting
confidentially as they went, the old lady
speaking emphatically and with many gesticulations
as they walked.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, this insignificant-looking person
was a woman of many secrets. She was a
"friend" of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale in Paris. She
lived, and lived well, in a pretty apartment in
Paris upon the handsome salary which she received
regularly each quarter. But she was seldom
at home. Like Walter, her days were spent
travelling hither and thither across Europe.</p>

<p>It would surprise the public if it were aware
of the truth&mdash;the truth of how, in every country
in Europe, there are secret female agents of po<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>lice
who (for a monetary consideration, of
course) keep watch in great centres where the
presence of a man would be suspected.</p>

<p>This secret police service is distinctly apart
from the detective service. The female police
agent in all countries works independently, at the
orders of the Director of Criminal Investigation,
and is known to him and his immediate staff.</p>

<p>Whatever information that wrinkled-faced
old Frenchwoman in shabby black had imparted
to Fetherston it was of an entirely confidential
character. It, however, caused him to leave her
about three o'clock, hurry to the Gare Porte-Neuve,
and, after hastily swallowing a liqueur of
brandy in the buffet, depart for Langres.</p>

<p>Thence he had travelled to Nancy, where he
had taken up quarters at the Grand Hotel in the
Place Stanislas, and had there remained for two
days in order to rest.</p>

<p>He would not have idled those autumn days
away so lazily, even though he so urgently required
rest after that rapid travelling, had he but
known that the person who occupied the next
room to his&mdash;that middle-aged commercial traveller&mdash;an
entirely inoffensive person who possessed
a red beard, and who had given the name of Jules
Dequanter, and his nationality as Belgian, native
of Li&egrave;ge&mdash;was none other than Gustav Heureux,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
the man who had been recalled from New York
by the evasive doctor of Pimlico.</p>

<p>And further, Fetherston, notwithstanding his
acuteness in observation, was in blissful ignorance,
as he strolled back from the station at Commercy,
up the old-world street, that a short distance
behind him, carefully watching all his movements,
was the man Joseph Blot himself&mdash;the
man known in dingy Pimlico as Dr. Weirmarsh.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h4>IF ANYONE KNEW</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Hugh Elcombe</span> spent a most interesting
and instructive day within the Fortress of Haudiomont.
He really did not want to go. The
visit bored him. The world was at peace, and
there was no incentive to espionage as there had
been in pre-war days.</p>

<p>General Henri Molon, the commandant,
greeted him cordially and himself showed him
over a portion of the post-war defences which
were kept such a strict secret from everyone. The
general did not, however, show his distinguished
guest everything. Such things as the new anti-aircraft
gun, the exact disposition of the huge
mines placed in the valley between there and
Rozellier, so that at a given signal both road
and railway tracks could be destroyed, he did not
point out. There were other matters to which the
smart, grey-haired, old French general deemed it
unwise to refer, even though his visitor might be
a high official of a friendly Power.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh noticed all this and smiled inwardly.
He wandered about the bomb-proof case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>-mates
hewn out of the solid rock, caring nothing
for the number and calibre of the guns, their
armoured protection, or the chart-like diagrams
upon the walls, ranges and the like.</p>

<p>"What a glorious evening!" Paul was saying
as, at sunset, they set their faces towards the
valley beyond which lay shattered Germany.
That peaceful land, the theatre of the recent war,
lay bathed in the soft rose of the autumn afterglow,
while the bright clearness of the sky, pale-green
and gold, foretold a frost.</p>

<p>"Yes, splendid!" responded his father-in-law
mechanically; but he was thinking of something
far more serious than the beauties of the western
sky. He was thinking of the grip in which he
was held by the doctor of Pimlico. At any moment,
if he cared to collapse, he could make ten
thousand pounds in a single day. The career of
many a man has been blasted for ever by the utterance
of cruel untruths or the repetition of
vague suspicions. Was his son-in-law, Le Pontois,
in jeopardy? He could not think that he
was. How could the truth come out? Sir Hugh
asked himself. It never had before&mdash;though his
friend had made a million sterling, and there was
no reason whatever why it should come out now.
He had tested Weirmarsh thoroughly, and knew
him to be a man to be trusted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
As he strolled on at his son-in-law's side, chatting
to him, he was full of anxiety as to the future.
He had left England, it was true. He had
defied the doctor. But the latter had been inexorable.
If he continued in his defiance, then
ruin must inevitably come to him.</p>

<p>Blanche and Enid had already returned, and
at dusk all four sat down to dinner together with
little Ninette, for whom "Aunt Enid" had
brought a new doll which had given the child the
greatest delight.</p>

<p>The meal ended, the bridge-table was set in
the pretty salon adjoining, and several games
were played until Sir Hugh, pleading fatigue,
at last ascended to his room.</p>

<p>Within, he locked the door and cast himself
into a chair before the big log fire to think.</p>

<p>That day had indeed been a strenuous one&mdash;strenuous
for any man. So occupied had been
his brain that he scarcely recollected any conversations
with those smart debonair officers to
whom Paul had introduced him.</p>

<p>As he sat there he closed his eyes, and before
him arose visions of interviews in dingy offices
in London, one of them behind Soho Square.</p>

<p>For a full hour he sat there immovable as a
statue, reflecting, ever recalling the details of
those events.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
Suddenly he sprang to his feet with clenched
hands.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, his teeth set and countenance
pale. "My God! If anybody ever
knew the truth!"</p>

<p>He crossed to the window, drew aside the
blind, and looked out upon the moonlit plains.</p>

<p>Below, his daughter was still playing the
piano and singing an old English ballad.</p>

<p>"She's happy, ah! my dear Blanche!" the
old man murmured between his teeth. "But if
suspicion falls upon me? Ah! if it does; then it
means ruin to them both&mdash;ruin because of a dastardly
action of mine!"</p>

<p>He returned unsteadily to his chair, and sat
staring straight into the embers, his hands to
his hot, fevered brow. More than once he sighed&mdash;sighed
heavily, as a man when fettered and
compelled to act against his better nature.</p>

<p>Again he heard his daughter's voice below,
now singing a gay little French chanson, a song
of the caf&eacute; chantant and of the Paris boulevards.</p>

<p>In a flash there recurred to him every incident
of those dramatic interviews with the Mephistophelean
doctor. He would at that moment
have given his very soul to be free of that calm,
clever, insinuating man who, while providing him
with a handsome, even unlimited income, yet at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
the same time held him irrevocably in the hollow
of his hand.</p>

<p>He, a brilliant British soldier with a magnificent
record, honoured by his sovereign, was,
after all, but a tool of that obscure doctor, the
man who had come into his life to rescue him
from bankruptcy and disgrace.</p>

<p>When he reflected he bit his lip in despair.
Yet there was no way out&mdash;<i>none</i>! Weirmarsh
had really been most generous. The cosy house
in Hill Street, the smart little entertainments
which his wife gave, the bit of shooting he rented
up in the Highlands, were all paid for with the
money which the doctor handed him in Treasury
notes with such regularity.</p>

<p>Yes, Weirmarsh was generous, but he was
nevertheless exacting, terribly exacting. His will
was the will of others.</p>

<p>The blazing logs had died down to a red mass,
the voice of Blanche had ceased. He had heard
footsteps an hour ago in the corridor outside, and
knew that the family had retired. There was
not a sound. All were asleep, save the sentries
high upon that hidden fortress. Again the old
general sighed wearily. His grey face now wore
an expression of resignation. He had thought
it all out, and saw that to resist and refuse would
only spell ruin for both himself and his family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
He had but himself to blame after all. He had
taken one false step, and he had been held inexorably
to his contract.</p>

<p>So he yawned wearily, rose, stretched himself,
and then, pacing the room twice, at last
turned up the lamp and placed it upon the small
writing-table at the foot of the bed. Afterwards
he took from his suit-case a quire of ruled foolscap
paper and a fountain pen, and, seating himself,
sat for some time with his head in his hands
deep in thought. Suddenly the clock in the big
hall below chimed two upon its peal of silvery
bells. This aroused him, and, taking up his pen,
he began to write.</p>

<p>Ever and anon as he wrote he sat back and reflected.</p>

<p>Hour after hour he sat there, bent to the table,
his pen rapidly travelling over the paper.
He wrote down many figures and was making
calculations.</p>

<p>At half-past four he put down his pen. The
sum was not complete, but it was one which he
knew would end his career and bring him into the
dock of a criminal court, and Weirmarsh and
others would stand beside him.</p>

<p>All this he had done in entire ignorance of
one startling fact&mdash;namely, that outside his window
for the past hour a dark figure had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
standing in an insecure position upon the lead
guttering of the wing of the ch&acirc;teau which ran
out at right angles, leaning forward and peering
in between the blind and the window-frame,
watching with interest all that had been in progress.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h4>CONCERNS THE PAST</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, a few days after Sir Hugh had
paid another visit to Haudiomont, he was smoking
with Paul prior to retiring to bed when the
conversation drifted upon money matters&mdash;some
investment he had made in England in his wife's
name.</p>

<p>Paul had allowed his father-in-law to handle
some of his money in England, for Sir Hugh
was very friendly with a man named Hewett in
the City, who had on several occasions put him
on good things.</p>

<p>Indeed, just before Sir Hugh had left London
he had had a wire from Paul to sell some
shares at a big profit, and he had brought over
the proceeds in Treasury notes, quite a respectable
sum. There had been a matter of concealing
certain payments, Sir Hugh explained, and that
was why he had brought over the money instead
of a cheque.</p>

<p>As they were chatting Sir Hugh, referring to
the transaction, said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
"Hewett suggested that I should have it in
notes&mdash;four five-hundred Bank of England ones
and the rest in Treasury notes."</p>

<p>"I sent them to the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais a few
days ago," replied his son-in-law. "Really, Sir
Hugh, you did a most excellent bit of business
with Hewett. I hope you profited yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, a little bit," laughed the old general.
"Can't complain, you know. I'm glad you've
sent the notes to the bank. It was a big sum to
keep in the house here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see only to-day they've credited me
with them," was his reply. "I hope you can induce
Hewett to do a bit more for us. Those aeroplane
shares are still going up, I see by the London
papers."</p>

<p>"And they'll continue to do so, my dear
Paul," was the reply. "But those Bolivian four
per cents. of yours I'd sell if I were you. They'll
never be higher."</p>

<p>"You don't think so?"</p>

<p>"Hewett warned me. He told me to tell you.
Of course, you're richer than I am, and can
afford to keep them. Only I warn you."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the younger man,
"when you get back, sell them, will you?"</p>

<p>And Sir Hugh promised that he would give
instructions to that effect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
"Really, my dear beau-p&egrave;re," Paul said,
"you've been an awfully good friend to me.
Since I left the army I've made quite a big sum
out of my speculations in London."</p>

<p>"And mostly paid with English notes, eh?"
laughed the elder man.</p>

<p>"Yes. Just let me see." And, taking a piece
of paper, he sat down at the writing-table and
made some quick calculations of various sums.
Upon one side he placed the money he had invested,
and on the other the profits, at last striking
a balance at the end. Then he told the general
the figure.</p>

<p>"Quite good," declared Sir Hugh. "I'm only
too glad, my dear Paul, to be of any assistance
to you. I fear you are vegetating here. But as
long as your wife doesn't mind it, what matters?"</p>

<p>"Blanche loves this country&mdash;which is fortunate,
seeing that I have this big place to attend
to." And as he said this he rose, screwed up the
sheet of thin note-paper, and tossed it into the
waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>The pair separated presently, and Sir Hugh
went to his room. He was eager and anxious to
get away and return to London, but there was
a difficulty. Enid, who had lately taken up amateur
theatricals, had accepted an invitation to
play in a comedy to be given at General Molon's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
house in a week's time in aid of the Croix Rouge.
Therefore he was compelled to remain on her account.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon Blanche drove
him in her car through the beautiful Bois de Hermeville,
glorious in its autumn gold, down to the
quaint old village of Warcq, to take "fif o'clock"
at the ch&acirc;teau with the Countess de Pierrepont,
Paul's widowed aunt.</p>

<p>Enid had pleaded a headache, but as soon as
the car had driven away she roused herself, and,
ascending to her room, put on strong country
boots and a leather-hemmed golf skirt, and, taking
a stick, set forth down the high road lined with
poplars in the direction of Mars-<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'le'">la</ins>-Tour.</p>

<p>About a mile from L&eacute;rouville she came to the
cross-roads, the one to the south leading over the
hills to Vigneulles, while the one to the north
joined the highway to Longuyon. For a moment
she paused, then turning into the latter road,
which at that point was little more than a byway,
hurried on until she came to the fringe of a wood,
where, upon her approach, a man in dark grey
tweeds came forth to meet her with swinging
gait.</p>

<p>It was Walter Fetherston.</p>

<p>He strode quickly in her direction, and when
they met he held her small hand in his and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
a moment gazed into her dark eyes without uttering
a word.</p>

<p>"At last!" he cried. "I was afraid that you
had not received my message&mdash;that it might have
been intercepted."</p>

<p>"I got it early this morning," was her reply,
her cheeks flushing with pleasure; "but I was
unable to get away before my father and Blanche
went out. They pressed me to go with them, so
I had to plead a headache."</p>

<p>"I am so glad we've met," Fetherston said.
"I have been here in the vicinity for days, yet
I feared to come near you lest your father should
recognise me."</p>

<p>"But why are you here?" she inquired, strolling
slowly at his side. "I thought you were in
London."</p>

<p>"I'm seldom in London," he responded.
"Nowadays I am constantly on the move."</p>

<p>"Travelling in search of fresh material for
your books, I suppose? I read in a paper the
other day that you never describe a place in your
stories without first visiting it. If so, you must
travel a great deal," the girl remarked.</p>

<p>"I do," he answered briefly. "And very
often I travel quickly."</p>

<p>"But why are you here?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
"For several reasons&mdash;the chief being to see
you, Enid."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl did not reply. This
man's movements so often mystified her. He
seemed ubiquitous. In one single fortnight he
had sent her letters from Paris, Stockholm, Hamburg,
Vienna and Constanza. His huge circle of
friends was unequalled. In almost every city
on the Continent he knew somebody, and he was
a perfect encyclop&aelig;dia of travel. His strange
reticence, however, always increased the mystery
surrounding him. Those vague whispers concerning
him had reached her ears, and she often
wondered whether half she heard concerning him
was true.</p>

<p>If a man prefers not to speak of himself or of
his doings, his enemies will soon invent some tale
of their own. And thus it was in Walter's case.
Men had uttered foul calumnies concerning him
merely because they believed him to be eccentric
and unsociable.</p>

<p>But Enid Orlebar, though she somehow
held him in suspicion, nevertheless liked him. In
certain moods he possessed that dash and devil-may-care
air which pleases most women, providing
the man is a cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>He was ever courteous, ever solicitous for her
welfare.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
She had known he loved her ever since they
had first met. Indeed, has he not told her so?</p>

<p>As they walked together down that grass-grown
byway through the wood, where the brown
leaves were floating down with every gust, she
glanced into his pale, dark, serious face and wondered.
In her nostrils was the autumn perfume
of the woods, and as they strode forward in silence
a rabbit scuttled from their path.</p>

<p>"You are, no doubt, surprised that I am
here," he commenced at last. "But it is in your
interests, Enid."</p>

<p>"In my interests?" she echoed. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Regarding the secret relations between your
stepfather and Doctor Weirmarsh," he answered.</p>

<p>"That same question we've discussed before,"
she said. "The doctor is attending to his practice
in Pimlico; he does not concern us here."</p>

<p>"I fear that he does," was Fetherston's quiet
response. "That man holds your stepfather's
future in his hand."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how can he?"</p>

<p>"By the same force by which he holds that
indescribable influence over you."</p>

<p>"You believe, then, that he possesses some
occult power?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. His power is the power which
every evil man possesses. And as far as my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
observation goes, I can detect that Sir Hugh has
fallen into some trap which has been cunningly
prepared for him."</p>

<p>Enid gasped and her countenance blanched.</p>

<p>"You believe, then, that those consultations
I have had with the doctor are at his own instigation?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly. Sir Hugh hates Weirmarsh,
but, fearing exposure, he must obey the
fellow's will."</p>

<p>"But cannot you discover the truth?" asked
the girl eagerly. "Cannot we free my stepfather?
He's such a dear old fellow, and is always
so good and kind to my mother and myself."</p>

<p>"That is exactly my object in asking you to
meet me here, Enid," said the novelist, his countenance
still thoughtful and serious.</p>

<p>"How can I assist?" she asked quickly.
"Only explain, and I will act upon any suggestion
you may make."</p>

<p>"You can assist by giving me answers to certain
questions," was his slow reply. The inquiry
was delicate and difficult to pursue without
arousing the girl's suspicions as to the exact situation
and the hideous scandal in progress.</p>

<p>"What do you wish to know?" she asked in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
some surprise, for she saw by his countenance
that he was deeply in earnest.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with some little hesitation,
glancing at her pale, handsome face as he walked
by her side, "I fear you may think me too inquisitive&mdash;that
the questions I'm going to ask
are out of sheer curiosity."</p>

<p>"I shall not if by replying I can assist my
stepfather to escape from that man's thraldom."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment; then he said
slowly: "I think Sir Hugh was in command of
a big training camp in Norfolk early in the war,
was he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I went with him, and we stayed for
about three months at the King's Head at
Beccles."</p>

<p>"And during the time you were at the King's
Head, did the doctor ever visit Sir Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the doctor stayed several times at the
Royal at Lowestoft. We both motored over on
several occasions and dined with him. Doctor
Weirmarsh was not well, so he had gone to the
east coast for a change."</p>

<p>"And he also came over to Beccles to see your
stepfather?"</p>

<p>"Yes; twice, or perhaps three times. One
evening after dinner, I remember, they left the
hotel and went for a long walk together. I rec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>ollect
it well, for I had been out all day and had
a bad headache. Therefore, the doctor went
along to the chemist's on his way out and ordered
me a draught."</p>

<p>"You took it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I went to sleep almost immediately,
and did not wake up till very late next
morning," she replied.</p>

<p>"You recollect, too, a certain man named
Bellairs?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" she sighed. "How very sad it
was! Poor Captain Bellairs was a great favourite
of the general, and served on his staff."</p>

<p>"He was with him in the Boer War, was he
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But how do you know all this?" asked
the girl, looking curiously at her questioner and
turning slightly paler.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied evasively, "I&mdash;I've been
told so, and wished to know whether it was a fact.
You and he were friends, eh?" he asked after a
pause.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl did not reply. A flood
of sad memories swept through her mind at the
mention of Harry Bellairs.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "we were great friends.
He took me to concerts and matin&eacute;es in town
sometimes. Sir Hugh always said he was a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
bound to make his mark. He had earned his
D.S.O. with French at Mons and was twice mentioned
in dispatches."</p>

<p>"And you, Enid," he said, still speaking very
slowly, his dark eyes fixed upon hers, "you would
probably have consented to become Mrs. Bellairs
had he lived to ask you? Tell me the truth."</p>

<p>Her eyes were cast down; he saw in them the
light of unshed tears.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for referring to such a painful
subject," he hastened to say, "but it is imperative."</p>

<p>"I thought that you were&mdash;were unaware of
the sad affair," she faltered.</p>

<p>"So I was until quite recently," he replied.
"I know how deeply it must pain you to speak
of it, but will you please explain to me the actual
facts? I know that you are better acquainted
with them than anyone else."</p>

<p>"The facts of poor Harry's death," she repeated
hoarsely, as though speaking to herself.
"Why recall them? Oh! why recall them?"</p>

<h4>REVEALS A CURIOUS PROBLEM</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> countenance of Enid Orlebar had changed;
her cheeks were deathly white, and her face was
sufficient index to a mind overwhelmed with grief
and regret.</p>

<p>"I asked you to explain, because I fear that
my information may be faulty. Captain Bellairs
died&mdash;<i>died suddenly</i>, did he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was a great blow to my stepfather,"
the girl said; "and&mdash;and by his unfortunate
death I lost one of my best friends."</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly how it occurred. I believe
the tragic event happened on September the second,
did it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "Mother and I had been
staying at the White Hart at Salisbury while Sir
Hugh had been inspecting some troops. Captain
Bellairs had been with us, as usual, but had been
sent up to London by my stepfather. That same
day I returned to London alone on my way to a
visit up in Yorkshire, and arrived at Hill Street
about seven o'clock. At a quarter to ten at night
I received an urgent note from Captain Bellairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
brought by a messenger, and written in a shaky
hand, asking me to call at once at his chambers
in Half Moon Street. He explained that he had
been taken suddenly ill, and that he wished to
see me upon a most important and private matter.
He asked me to go to him, as it was most
urgent. Mother and I had been to his chambers
to tea several times before; therefore, realising
the urgency of his message, I found a taxi and
went at once to him."</p>

<p>She broke off short, and with difficulty swallowed
the lump which arose in her throat.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Fetherston in a low, sympathetic
voice.</p>

<p>"When I arrived," she said, "I&mdash;I found
him lying dead! He had expired just as I ascended
the stairs."</p>

<p>"Then you learned nothing, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said in a low voice. "I have
ever since wondered what could have been the
private matter upon which he so particularly desired
to see me. He felt death creeping upon
him, or&mdash;or else he knew himself to be a doomed
man&mdash;or he would never have penned me that
note."</p>

<p>"The letter in question was not mentioned at
the inquest?"</p>

<p>"No. My stepfather urged me to regard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
affair as a strict secret. He feared a scandal because
I had gone to Harry's rooms."</p>

<p>"You have no idea, then, what was the nature
of the communication which the captain
wished to make to you?" asked the novelist.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," replied the girl, yet with
some hesitation. "It is all a mystery&mdash;a mystery
which has ever haunted me&mdash;a mystery which
haunts me now!"</p>

<p>They had halted, and were standing together
beneath a great oak, already partially bare of
leaves. He looked into her beautiful face, sweet
and full of purity as a child's. Then, in a low,
intense voice, he said: "Cannot you be quite
frank with me, Enid&mdash;cannot you give me more
minute details of the sad affair? Captain Bellairs
was in his usual health that day when he left
you at Salisbury, was he not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I drove him to the station in our
car."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea why your stepfather sent
him up to London?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, except that at breakfast he
said to my mother that he must send Bellairs up
to London. That was all."</p>

<p>"And at his rooms, whom did you find?"</p>

<p>"Barker, his man," she replied. "The story
he told me was a curious one, namely, that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
master had arrived from Salisbury at two o'clock,
and at half-past two had sent him out upon a
message down to Richmond. On his return, a
little after five, he found his master absent, but
the place smelt strongly of perfume, which
seemed to point to the fact that the captain had
had a lady visitor."</p>

<p>"He had no actual proof of that?" exclaimed
Fetherston, interrupting.</p>

<p>"I think not. He surmised it from the fact
that his master disliked scent, even in his toilet
soap. Again, upon the table in the hall Barker's
quick eye noticed a small white feather; this he
showed me, and it was evidently from a feather
boa. In the fire-grate a letter had been burnt.
These two facts had aroused the man-servant's
curiosity."</p>

<p>"What time did the captain return?"</p>

<p>"Almost immediately. He changed into his
dinner jacket, and went forth again, saying that
he intended to dine at the Naval and Military
Club, and return to his rooms in time to change
and catch the eleven-fifteen train from Waterloo
for Salisbury that same night. He even told
Barker which suit of clothes to prepare. It seems,
however, that he came in about a quarter-past
nine, and sent Barker on a message to Waterloo
Station. On the man's return he found his mas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>ter
fainting in his arm-chair. He called Barker
to get him a glass of water&mdash;his throat seemed
on fire, he said. Then, obtaining pen and paper,
he wrote that hurried message to me. Barker
stated that three minutes after addressing the envelope
he fell into a state of coma, the only word
he uttered being my name." And she pressed
her lips together.</p>

<p>"It is evident, then, that he earnestly desired
to speak to you&mdash;to tell you something," her companion
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on quickly. "I found him
lying back in his big arm-chair, quite dead. Barker
had feared to leave his side, and summoned
the doctor and messenger-boy by telephone.
When I entered, however, the doctor had not arrived."</p>

<p>"It was a thousand pities that you were too
late. He wished to make some important statement
to you, without a doubt."</p>

<p>"I rushed to him at once, but, alas! was just
too late."</p>

<p>"He carried that secret, whatever it was, with
him to the grave," Fetherston said reflectively.
"I wonder what it could have been?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the girl, her face yet paler.
"I wonder&mdash;I constantly wonder."</p>

<p>"The doctors who made the post-mortem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
could not account for the death, I believe. I
have read the account of the inquest."</p>

<p>"Ah! then you know what transpired there,"
the girl said quickly. "I was in court, but was
not called as a witness. There was no reason
why I should be asked to make any statement, for
Barker, in his evidence, made no mention of the
letter which the dead man had sent me. I sat
and heard the doctors&mdash;both of whom expressed
themselves puzzled. The coroner put it to them
whether they suspected foul play, but the reply
they gave was a distinctly negative one."</p>

<p>"The poor fellow's death was a mystery," her
companion said. "I noticed that an open verdict
was returned."</p>

<p>"Yes. The most searching inquiry was made,
although the true facts regarding it were never
made public. Sir Hugh explained one day at
the breakfast-table that in addition to the two
doctors who made the examination of the body,
Professors Dale and Boyd, the analysts of the
Home Office, also made extensive experiments,
but could detect no symptom of poisoning."</p>

<p>"Where he had dined that night has never
been discovered, eh?"</p>

<p>"Never. He certainly did not dine at the
club."</p>

<p>"He may have dined with his lady visitor,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
Fetherston remarked, his eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, as though unwilling
to admit that Bellairs should have entertained
the unknown lady in secret.</p>

<p>"He may have done so, of course," she said
with some reluctance.</p>

<p>"Was there any other fact beside the feather
which would lead one to suppose that a lady had
visited him?"</p>

<p>"Only the perfume. Barker declared that it
was a sweet scent, such as he had never smelt
before. The whole place 'reeked with it,' as he
put it."</p>

<p>"No one saw the lady call at his chambers?"</p>

<p>"Nobody came forward with any statement,"
replied the girl. "I myself made every inquiry
possible, but, as you know, a woman is much
handicapped in such a matter. Barker, who was
devoted to his master, spared no effort, but he
has discovered nothing."</p>

<p>"For aught we know to the contrary, Captain
Bellairs' death may have been due to perfectly
natural causes," Fetherston remarked.</p>

<p>"It may have been, but the fact of his mysterious
lady visitor, and that he dined at some
unknown place on that evening, aroused my suspicions.
Yet there was no evidence whatever
either of poison or of foul play."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
Fetherston raised his eyes and shot a covert
glance at her&mdash;a glance of distinct suspicion. His
keen, calm gaze was upon her, noting the unusual
expression upon her countenance, and how
her gloved fingers had clenched themselves
slightly as she had spoken. Was she telling him
all that she knew concerning the extraordinary
affair? That was the question which had arisen
at that moment within his mind.</p>

<p>He had perused carefully the cold, formal reports
which had appeared in the newspapers concerning
the "sudden death" of Captain Henry
Bellairs, and had read suspicion between the lines,
as only one versed in mysteries of crime could
read. Were not such mysteries the basis of his
profession? He had been first attracted by it as
a possible plot for a novel, but, on investigation,
had discovered, to his surprise, that Bellairs had
been Sir Hugh's trusted secretary and the friend
of Enid Orlebar.</p>

<p>The poor fellow had died in a manner both
sudden and mysterious, as a good many persons
die annually. To the outside world there was no
suspicion whatever of foul play.</p>

<p>Yet, being in possession of certain secret
knowledge, Fetherston had formed a theory&mdash;one
that was amazing and startling&mdash;a theory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
which he had, after long deliberation, made up
his mind to investigate and prove.</p>

<p>This girl had loved Harry Bellairs before he
had met her, and because of it the poor fellow
had fallen beneath the hand of a secret assassin.</p>

<p>She stood there in ignorance that he had already
seen and closely questioned Barker in London,
and that the man had made an admission,
an amazing statement&mdash;namely, that the subtle
Eastern perfume upon Enid Orlebar, when she
arrived so hurriedly and excitedly at Half Moon
Street, was the same which had greeted his nostrils
when he entered his master's chambers on
his return from that errand upon which he had
been sent.</p>

<p>Enid Orlebar had been in the captain's rooms
during his absence!</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h4>THE MYSTERIOUS MR. MALTWOOD</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> Enid Orlebar's story contained several discrepancies.</p>

<p>She had declared that she arrived at Hill
Street about seven o'clock on that fateful second
of September. That might be true, but might
she not have arrived after her secret visit to Half
Moon Street?</p>

<p>In suppressing the fact that she had been
there at all she had acted with considerable foresight.
Naturally, her parents were not desirous
of the fact being stated publicly that she had
gone alone to a bachelor's rooms, and they had,
therefore, assisted her to preserve the secret&mdash;known
only to Barker and to the doctor. Yet her
evidence had been regarded as immaterial, hence
she had not been called as witness.</p>

<p>Only Barker had suspected. That unusual
perfume about her had puzzled him. Yet how
could he make any direct charge against the general's
stepdaughter, who had always been most
generous to him in the matter of tips? Besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
did not the captain write a note to her with his
last dying effort?</p>

<p>What proof was there that the pair had not
dined together? Fetherston had already made
diligent inquiries at Hill Street, and had discovered
from the butler that Miss Enid, on her arrival
home from Salisbury, had changed her
gown and gone out in a taxi at a quarter to eight.
She had dined out&mdash;but where was unknown.</p>

<p>It was quite true that she had come in before
ten o'clock, and soon afterwards had received a
note by boy-messenger.</p>

<p>In view of these facts it appeared quite certain
to Fetherston that Enid and Harry Bellairs
had taken dinner <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> at some quiet restaurant.
She was a merry, high-spirited girl to
whom such an adventure would certainly appeal.</p>

<p>After dinner they had parted, and he had
driven to his rooms. Then, feeling his strength
failing, he had hastily summoned her to his side.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>If he had suspected her of being the author
of any foul play he most certainly would not have
begged her to come to him in his last moments.
No. The enigma grew more and more inscrutable.</p>

<p>And yet there was a motive for poor Bellairs'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
tragic end&mdash;one which, in the light of his own
knowledge, seemed only too apparent.</p>

<p>He strolled on beside the fair-faced girl,
deep in wonder. Recollections of that devil-may-care
cavalry officer who had been such a
good friend clouded her brow, and as she walked
her eyes were cast upon the ground in silent reflection.</p>

<p>She was wondering whether Walter Fetherston
had guessed the truth, that she had loved
that man who had met with such an untimely end.</p>

<p>Her companion, on his part, was equally puzzled.
That story of Barker's finding a white
feather was a curious one. It was true that the
man had found a white feather&mdash;but he had also
learnt that when Enid Orlebar had arrived at
Hill Street she had been wearing a white feather
boa!</p>

<p>"It is not curious, after all," he said reflectively,
"that the police should have dismissed the
affair as a death from natural causes. At the inquest
no suspicion whatever was aroused. I wonder
why Barker, in his evidence, made no mention
of that perfume&mdash;or of the discovery of the
feather?"</p>

<p>And as he uttered those words he fixed his
grave eyes upon her, watching her countenance
intently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
"Well," she replied, after a moment's hesitation,
"if he had it would have proved nothing,
would it? If the captain had received a lady visitor
in secret that afternoon it might have had
no connection with the circumstances of his death
six hours later."</p>

<p>"And yet it might," Fetherston remarked.
"What more natural than that the lady who visited
him clandestinely&mdash;for Barker had, no doubt,
been sent out of the way on purpose that he
should not see her&mdash;should have dined with him
later?"</p>

<p>The girl moved uneasily, tapping the ground
with her stick.</p>

<p>"Then you suspect some woman of having
had a hand in his death?" she exclaimed in a
changed voice, her eyes again cast upon the
ground.</p>

<p>"I do not know sufficient of the details to
entertain any distinct suspicion," he replied. "I
regard the affair as a mystery, and in mysteries
I am always interested."</p>

<p>"You intend to bring the facts into a book,"
she remarked. "Ah! I see."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;if I obtain a solution of the enigma&mdash;for
enigma it certainly is."</p>

<p>"You agree with me, then, that poor Harry
was the victim of foul play?" she asked in a low,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>
intense voice, eagerly watching his face the while.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered very slowly, "and, further,
that the woman who visited him that afternoon
was an accessory. Harry Bellairs was <i>murdered</i>!"</p>

<p>Her cheeks blanched and she went pale to the
lips. He saw the sudden change in her, and realised
what a supreme effort she was making to
betray no undue alarm. But the effect of his
cold, calm words had been almost electrical. He
watched her countenance slowly flushing, but pretended
not to notice her confusion. And so he
walked on at her side, full of wonderment.</p>

<p>How much did she know? Why, indeed, had
Harry Bellairs fallen the victim of a secret assassin?</p>

<p>No trained officer of the Criminal Investigation
Department was more ingenious in making
secret inquiries, more clever in his subterfuges
or in disguising his real objects, than Walter
Fetherston. Possessed of ample means, and
member of that secret club called "Our Society,"
which meets at intervals and is the club of criminologists,
and pursuing the detection of crime
as a pastime, he had on many occasions placed
Scotland Yard and the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; in Paris in possession
of information which had amazed them
and which had earned for him the high esteem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
of those in office as Ministers of the Interior in
Paris, Rome and in London.</p>

<p>The case of Captain Henry Bellairs he had
taken up merely because he recognised in it some
unusual circumstances, and without sparing effort
he had investigated it rapidly and secretly
from every standpoint. He had satisfied himself.
Certain knowledge that he had was not
possessed by any officer at Scotland Yard, and
only by reason of that secret knowledge had he
been able to arrive at the definite conclusion that
there had been a strong motive for the captain's
death, and that if he had been secretly poisoned&mdash;which
seemed to be the case, in spite of the
analysts' evidence&mdash;then he had been poisoned by
the velvet hand of a woman.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston was ever regretting his
inability to put any of the confidential information
he acquired into his books.</p>

<p>"If I could only write half the truth of what
I know, people would declare it to be fiction,"
he had often assured intimate friends. And those
friends had pondered and wondered to what he
referred.</p>

<p>He wrote of crime, weaving those wonderful
romances which held breathless his readers in
every corner of the globe, and describing criminals
and life's undercurrents with such fidelity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
that even criminals themselves had expressed
wonder as to how and whence he obtained his accurate
information.</p>

<p>But the public were in ignorance that, in his
character of Mr. Maltwood, he pursued a strange
profession, one which was fraught with more romance
and excitement than any other calling a
man could adopt. In comparison with his life
that of a detective was really a tame one; while
such success had he obtained that in a certain important
official circle in London he was held in
highest esteem and frequently called into consultation.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston, the quiet, reticent novelist,
was entirely different from the gay, devil-may-care
Maltwood, the accomplished linguist,
thorough-going cosmopolitan and constant traveller,
the easy-going man of means known in society
in every European capital.</p>

<p>Because of this his few friends who were
aware of his dual personality were puzzled.</p>

<p>At the girl's side he strode on along the road
which still led through the wood, the road over
which every evening rumbled the old post-diligence
on its way through the quaint old town of
Etain to the railway at Spincourt. On that very
road a battalion of Uhlans had been annihilated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
almost to a man at the outbreak of the Great
War.</p>

<p>Every m&egrave;tre they trod was historic ground&mdash;ground
which had been contested against the legions
of the Crown Prince's army.</p>

<p>For some time neither spoke. At last Walter
asked: "Your stepfather has been up to the
fortress with Monsieur Le Pontois, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once or twice," was her reply, eager
to change the subject. "Of course, to a soldier,
fortifications and suchlike things are always of
interest."</p>

<p>"I saw them walking up to the fortress together
the other day," he remarked with a casual
air.</p>

<p>"What?" she asked quickly. "Have you
been here before?"</p>

<p>"Once," he laughed. "I came over from
Commercy and spent the day in your vicinity in
the hope that I might perhaps meet you alone
accidentally."</p>

<p>He did not tell her that he had watched her
shopping with Madame Le Pontois, or that he
had spent several days at a small <i>auberge</i> at the
tiny village of Marcheville-en-Woevre, only two
miles distant.</p>

<p>"I had no idea of that," she replied, her face
flushing slightly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
"When do you return to London?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I hardly know. Certainly not before next
Thursday, as we have amateur theatricals at General
Molon's. I am playing the part of Miss
Smith, the English governess, in Darbour's comedy,
<i>Le Pyr&eacute;e</i>."</p>

<p>"And then you return to London, eh?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know. Yesterday I had a letter
from Mrs. Caldwell saying that she contemplated
going to Italy this winter; therefore, perhaps
mother will let me go. I wrote to her this morning.
The proposal is to spend part of the time
in Italy, and then cross from Naples to Egypt.
I love Egypt. We were there some winters ago,
at the Winter Palace at Luxor."</p>

<p>"Your father and mother will remain at
home, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Mother hates travelling nowadays. She
says she had quite sufficient of living abroad in
my father's lifetime. We were practically exiled
for years, you know. I was born in Lima, and I
never saw England till I was eleven. The Diplomatic
Service takes one so out of touch with
home."</p>

<p>"But Sir Hugh will go abroad this winter,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I have not heard him speak of it. I believe
he's too busy at the War Office just now. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
have some more 'reforms' in progress, I hear,"
and she smiled.</p>

<p>He was looking straight into the girl's handsome
face, his heart torn between love and suspicion.</p>

<p>Those days at Biarritz recurred to him; how
he would watch for her and go and meet her
down towards Grande Plage, till, by degrees, it
had become to both the most natural thing in the
world. On those rare evenings when they did
not meet the girl was conscious of a little feeling
of disappointment which she was too shy to own,
even to her own heart.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston owned it freely enough.
In that bright springtime the day was incomplete
unless he saw her; and he knew that, even
now, every hour was making her grow dearer to
him. From that chance meeting at the hotel their
friendship had grown, and had ripened into something
warmer, dearer&mdash;a secret held closely in
each heart, but none the less sweet for that.</p>

<p>After leaving Biarritz the man had torn himself
from her&mdash;why, he hardly knew. Only he
felt upon him some fatal fascination, strong and
irresistible. It was the first time in his life that
he had been what is vulgarly known as "over
head and ears in love."</p>

<p>He returned to England, and then, a month<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
later, his investigation of Henry Bellairs' death,
for the purpose of obtaining a plot for a new
novel he contemplated, revealed to him a staggering
and astounding truth.</p>

<p>Even then, in face of that secret knowledge
he had gained, he had been powerless, and he had
gone up to Monifieth deliberately again to meet
her&mdash;to be drawn again beneath the spell of
those wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>There was love in the man's heart. But sometimes
it embittered him. It did at that moment,
as they strolled still onward over that carpet of
moss and fallen leaves. He had loved her, as he
believed her to be a woman with heart and soul
too pure to harbour an evil thought. But her
story of the death of poor Bellairs, the man who
had loved her, had convinced him that his suspicions
were, alas! only too well grounded.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h4>WHAT CONFESSION WOULD MEAN</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">A silence</span> had fallen between the pair. Again
Walter Fetherston glanced at her.</p>

<p>She was an outdoor girl to the tips of her
fingers. At shooting parties she went out with
the guns, not merely contenting herself, as did
the other girls, to motor down with the luncheon
for the men. She never got dishevelled or untidy,
and her trim tweed skirt and serviceable
boots never made her look unwomanly. She was
her dainty self out in the country with the men,
just as in the pretty drawing-room at Hill Street,
while her merry laugh evoked more smiles and
witticisms than the more studied attempts at wit
of the others.</p>

<p>At that moment she had noticed the change
in the man she had so gradually grown to love,
and her heart was beating in wild tumult.</p>

<p>He, on his part, was hating himself for so
foolishly allowing her to steal into his heart.
She had lied to him there, just as she had lied to
him at Biarritz. And yet he had been a fool, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
had allowed himself to be drawn back to her side.</p>

<p>Why? he asked himself. Why? There was
a reason, a strong reason. He loved her, and
the reason he was at that moment at her side was
to save her, to rescue her from a fate which he
knew must sooner or later befall her.</p>

<p>She made some remark, but he only replied
mechanically. His countenance had, she saw,
changed and become paler. His lips were pressed
together, and, taking a cigar from his case, he
asked her permission to smoke, and viciously bit
off its end. Something had annoyed him. Was
it possible that he held any suspicion of the
ghastly truth?</p>

<p>The real fact, however, was that he was calmly
and deliberately contemplating tearing her
from his heart for ever as an object of suspicion
and worthless. He, who had never yet fallen beneath
a woman's thraldom, resolved not to enter
blindly the net she had spread for him. His
thoughts were hard and bitter&mdash;the thoughts of
a man who had loved passionately, but whose idol
had suddenly been shattered.</p>

<p>Again she spoke, remarking that it was time
she turned back, for already they were at the
opposite end of the wood, with a beautiful panorama
of valley and winding river spread before
them. But he only answered a trifle abruptly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
and, acting upon her suggestion, turned and retraced
his steps in silence.</p>

<p>At last, as though suddenly rousing himself,
he turned to her, and said in an apologetic tone:
"I fear, Enid, I've treated you rather&mdash;well,
rather uncouthly. I apologise. I was thinking
of something else&mdash;a somewhat serious matter."</p>

<p>"I knew you were," she laughed, affecting
to treat the matter lightly. "You scarcely replied
to me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, won't you?" he asked, smiling
again in his old way.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said. "But&mdash;but is the
matter very serious? Does it concern yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Enid, it does," he answered.</p>

<p>And still she walked on, her eyes cast down,
much puzzled.</p>

<p>Two woodmen passed on their way home from
work, and raised their caps politely, while Walter
acknowledged their salutation in French.</p>

<p>"I shall probably leave here to-morrow," her
companion said as they walked back to the high
road. "I am not yet certain until I receive my
letters to-night."</p>

<p>"You are now going back to your village inn,
I suppose," she laughed cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "My host is an interesting
old countryman, and has told me quite a lot about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>
the war. He was wounded when the Germans
shelled Verdun. He has told me that he knows
Paul Le Pontois, for his son Jean is his servant."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Fetherston, you are really ubiquitous,"
cried the girl in confusion. "Why have
you been watching us like this?"</p>

<p>"Merely because I wished to see you, as I've
already explained," was his reply. "I wanted
to ask you those questions which I have put to
you this afternoon."</p>

<p>"About poor Harry?" she remarked in a
hoarse, low voice. "But you begged me to reply
to you in my own interests&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Because I wished to know the real truth."</p>

<p>"Well, I've told you the truth," she said with
just the slightest tinge of defiance in her voice.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not speak. He had
halted; his grave eyes were fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"Have you told me the whole truth&mdash;all that
you know, Enid?" he asked very quietly a moment
later.</p>

<p>"What more should I know?" she protested
after a second's hesitation.</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" he asked quickly. "I
only ask you to place me in possession of all the
facts within your knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me this?" she cried. "Is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
out of mere idle curiosity? Or is it because&mdash;because,
knowing that Harry loved me, you wish to
cause me pain by recalling those tragic circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Neither," was his quiet answer in a low,
sympathetic voice. "I am your friend, Enid.
And if you will allow me, I will assist you."</p>

<p>She held her breath. He spoke as though
he were aware of the truth&mdash;that she had not told
him everything&mdash;that she was still concealing certain
important and material facts.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I know you are my friend," she faltered.
"I have felt that all along, ever since our first
meeting. But&mdash;but forgive me, I beg of you.
The very remembrance of that night of the second
of September is, to me, horrible&mdash;horrible."</p>

<p>To him those very words of hers increased his
suspicion. Was it any wonder that she was horrified
when she recalled that gruesome episode of
the death of a brave and honest man? Her personal
fascination had overwhelmed Harry Bellairs,
just as it had overwhelmed himself. The
devil sends some women into the hearts of upright
men to rend and destroy them.</p>

<p>Upon her cheeks had spread a deadly pallor,
while in the centre of each showed a scarlet spot.
Her heart was torn by a thousand emotions, for
the image of that man whom she had seen lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
cold and dead in his room had arisen before her
vision, blotting out everything. The hideous remembrance
of that fateful night took possession
of her soul.</p>

<p>In silence they walked on for a considerable
time. Now and then a rabbit scuttled from their
path into the undergrowth or the alarm-cry of
a bird broke the evening stillness, until at last
they came forth into the wide highway, their faces
set towards the autumn sunset.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man spoke.</p>

<p>"Have you heard of the doctor since you left
London?" he asked.</p>

<p>She held her breath&mdash;only for a single second.
But her hesitation was sufficient to show him that
she intended to conceal the truth.</p>

<p>"No," was her reply. "He has not written
to me."</p>

<p>Again he was silent. There was a reason&mdash;a
strong reason&mdash;why Weirmarsh should not write
to her, he knew. But he had, by his question,
afforded her an opportunity of telling him the
truth&mdash;the truth that the mysterious George
Weirmarsh was there, in that vicinity. That
Enid was aware of that fact was certain to him.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said at last, "I wish you would
call at the ch&acirc;teau and allow me to introduce you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
to Paul and his wife. They would be charmed
to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he replied a trifle coldly; "I'd
rather not know them&mdash;in the present circumstances."</p>

<p>"Why, how strange you are!" the girl exclaimed,
looking up into his face, so dark and
serious. "I don't see why you should entertain
such an aversion to being introduced to Paul.
He's quite a dear fellow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a foolish reluctance on my
part," he laughed uneasily. "But, somehow, I
feel that to remain away from the ch&acirc;teau is best.
Remember, your stepfather and your mother are
in ignorance of&mdash;well, of the fact that we regard
each other as&mdash;as more than close friends. For
the present it is surely best that I should not visit
your relations. Relations are often very prompt
to divine the real position of affairs. Parents
may be blind," he laughed, "but brothers-in-law
never."</p>

<p>"You are always so dreadfully philosophical!"
the girl cried, glad that at last that painful
topic of conversation had been changed. "Paul
Le Pontois wouldn't eat you!"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose any Frenchman is given to
cannibalistic diet," he answered, smiling. "But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
the fact is, I have my reasons for not being introduced
to the Le Pontois family just now."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him sharply, surprised at
the tone of his response. She tried to divine its
meaning. But his countenance still bore that
sphinx-like expression which so often caused his
friends to entertain vague suspicions.</p>

<p>Few men could read character better than
Walter Fetherston. To him the minds of most
men and women he met were as an open book.
To a marvellous degree had he cultivated his
power of reading the inner working of the mind
by the expression in the eyes and on the faces of
even those hard-headed diplomats and men of
business whom, in his second character of Mr.
Maltwood, he so frequently met. Few men or
women could tell him a deliberate lie without its
instant detection. Most shrewd men possess that
power to a greater or less degree&mdash;a power that
can be developed by painstaking application and
practice.</p>

<p>Enid asked her companion when they were to
meet again.</p>

<p>"At least let me see you before you go from
here," she said. "I know what a rapid traveller
you always are."</p>

<p>"Yes," he sighed. "I'm often compelled to
make quick journeys from one part of the Conti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>nent
to the other. I am a constant traveller&mdash;too
constant, perhaps, for I've nowadays grown
very world-weary and restless."</p>

<p>"Well," she exclaimed, "if you will not
come to the ch&acirc;teau, where shall we meet?"</p>

<p>"I will write to you," he replied. "At this
moment my movements are most uncertain&mdash;they
depend almost entirely upon the movements of
others. At any moment I may be called away.
But a letter to Holles Street will always find me,
you know."</p>

<p>He seemed unusually serious and strangely
preoccupied, she thought. She noticed, too, that
he had flung away his half-consumed cigar in impatience,
and that he had rubbed his chin with
his left hand, a habit of his when puzzled.</p>

<p>At the crossroads where the leafless poplars
ran in straight lines towards the village of Fresnes,
a big red motor-car passed them at a tearing
pace, and in it Enid recognised General
Molon.</p>

<p>Fetherston, although an ardent motorist himself,
cursed the driver under his breath for bespattering
them with mud. Then, with a word
of apology to his charming companion, he held
her gloved hand for a moment in his.</p>

<p>Their parting was not prolonged. The man's
lips were thin and hard, for his resolve was firm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
This girl whom he had grown to love&mdash;who
was the very sunshine of his strange, adventurous
life&mdash;was, he had at last realised, unworthy.
If he was to live, if the future was to have hope
and joy for him, he must tear her out of his life.</p>

<p>Therefore he bade her adieu, refusing to give
her any tryst for the morrow.</p>

<p>"It is all so uncertain," he repeated. "You
will write to me in London if you do not hear
from me, won't you?"</p>

<p>She nodded, but scarce a word, save a murmured
farewell, escaped her dry lips.</p>

<p>He was changed, sadly changed, she knew.
She turned from him with overflowing heart, stifling
her tears, but with a veritable volcano of
emotion within her young breast.</p>

<p>He had changed&mdash;changed entirely and utterly
in that brief hour and a half they had
walked together. What had she said? What
had she done? she asked herself.</p>

<p>Forward she went blindly with the blood-red
light of the glorious sunset full in her hard-set
face, the great fortress-crowned hills looming up
before her, a barrier between herself and the beyond!
They looked grey, dark, mysterious as
her own future.</p>

<p>She glanced back, but he had turned upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
his heel, and she now saw his retreating figure
swinging along the straight, broad highway.</p>

<p>Why had he treated her thus? Was it possible,
she reflected, that he had actually become
aware of the ghastly truth? Had he divined it?</p>

<p>"If he has," she cried aloud in an agony of
soul, "then no wonder&mdash;no wonder, indeed, that
he has cast me from his life as a criminal&mdash;as
a woman to be avoided as the plague&mdash;that he has
said good-bye to me for ever!"</p>

<p>Her lips trembled, and the corners of her
pretty mouth hardened.</p>

<p>She turned again to watch the man's disappearing
figure.</p>

<p>"I would go back," she cried in despair,
"back to him, and beg his forgiveness upon my
knees. I love him&mdash;love him better than my life!
Yet to crave forgiveness would be to confess&mdash;to
tell all I know&mdash;the whole awful truth! And I
can't do that&mdash;no, never! God help me! I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;can't
do that!"</p>

<p>And bursting into a flood of hot tears, she
stood rigid, her small hands clenched, still watching
him until he disappeared from her sight
around the bend of the road.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured in a low, hoarse voice,
still speaking to herself, "confession would mean
death. Rather than admit the truth I would take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
my own life. I would kill myself, yes, face death
freely and willingly, rather than he&mdash;the man I
love so well&mdash;should learn Sir Hugh's disgraceful
secret."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h4>THREE GENTLEMEN FROM PARIS</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Gaston Darbour's</span> comedy, <i>Le Pyr&eacute;e</i>, had been
played to a large audience assembled in one of
the bigger rooms of the long whitewashed artillery
barracks outside Ronvaux, where General
Molon had his official residence.</p>

<p>The humorous piece had been applauded to
the echo&mdash;the audience consisting for the most
part of military officers in uniform and their
wives and daughters, with a sprinkling of the
better-class civilians from the various ch&acirc;teaux
in the neighbourhood, together with two or three
aristocratic parties from Longuyon, Spincourt,
and other places.</p>

<p>The honours of the evening had fallen to the
young English girl who had played the amusing
part of the demure governess, Miss Smith&mdash;pronounced
by the others "Mees Smeeth." Enid
was passionately fond of dramatic art, and belonged
to an amateur club in London. Among
those present were the author of the piece himself,
a dark young man with smooth hair parted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
in the centre and wearing an exaggerated black
cravat.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell the audience rose to
chatter and comment, and were a long time before
they dispersed. Paul Le Pontois waited for
Enid, Sir Hugh accompanying Blanche and little
Ninette home in the hired brougham. As the
party had a long distance to go, some twelve kilom&egrave;tres,
General Molon had lent Le Pontois his
motor-car, which now stood awaiting him with
glaring headlights in the barrack-square.</p>

<p>As the hall emptied Paul glanced around him
while awaiting Enid. On the walls the French
tricolour was everywhere displayed, the revered
<i>drapeau</i> under which he had so gallantly and
nobly served against the Huns.</p>

<p>He presented a spruce appearance in his
smart, well-cut evening coat, with the red button
of the Legion d'Honneur in his lapel, and to the
ladies who wished him "bon soir" as they filed
out he drew his heels together and bowed gallantly.</p>

<p>Outside, the night was cloudy and overcast.
In the long rows of the barrack windows lights
shone, and somewhere sounded a bugle, while in
the shadows could be heard the measured tramp
of sentries, the clank of spurs, or the click of
rifles as they saluted their officers passing out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
The whole atmosphere was a military one, for,
indeed, the little town of Ronvaux is, even in
these peace days, scarcely more than a huge camp.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Le Pontois stood chatting
to a group of men at the door. They had invited
him to come across to their quarters, but he had
explained that he was awaiting mademoiselle. So
they raised their eyebrows, smiled mischievously,
and bade him "bon soir."</p>

<p>Soldiers were already stacking up the chairs
ready for the clearance of the gymnasium for the
morrow. Others were coming to water and sweep
out the place. Therefore Le Pontois remained
outside in the square, waiting in patience.</p>

<p>He was reflecting. That evening, as he had
sat with his wife watching the play, he had been
seized by a curious feeling for which he entirely
failed to account. Behind him there had sat a
man and a woman, French without a doubt, but
entire strangers. They must, of course, have
known one or other of the officers in order to obtain
an admission ticket. Nevertheless, they had
spoken to no one, and on the fall of the curtain
had entered a brougham in waiting and driven
off.</p>

<p>Paul had made no comment. By a sudden
chance he had, during the entr'acte, risen and
gazed around, when the face of the stranger had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
caught his eyes&mdash;a face which he felt was curiously
familiar, yet he could not place it. The
middle-aged man was dressed with quiet elegance,
clean-shaven and keen-faced, apparently a prosperous
civilian, while the lady with him was of
about the same age and apparently his wife. She
was dressed in a high-necked dress of black lace,
and wore in her corsage a large circular ornament
of diamonds and emeralds.</p>

<p>Twice had Le Pontois taken furtive glances
at the stranger whose lined brow was so extraordinarily
familiar. It was the face of a deep
thinker, a man who had, perhaps, passed through
much trouble. Was it possible, he wondered, that
he had seen that striking face in some photograph,
or perhaps in some illustrated paper? He
had racked his brain through the whole performance,
but could not decide in what circumstances
they had previously met.</p>

<p>From time to time the stranger had joined
with the audience in their hearty laughter, or applauded
as vociferously as the others, his companion
being equally amused at the quaint sayings
of the demure "Mees Smeeth."</p>

<p>And even as he stood in the shadows near the
general's car awaiting Enid he was still wondering
who the pair might be.</p>

<p>At the fall of the curtain he had made several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
inquiries of the officers, but nobody could give
him any information. They were complete strangers&mdash;that
was all. Even a search among the
cards of invitation had revealed nothing.</p>

<p>So Paul Le Pontois remained mystified.</p>

<p>Enid came at last, flushed with success and
apologetic because she had kept him waiting.
But he only congratulated her, and assisted her
into the car. It was a big open one, therefore
she wore a thick motor coat and veil as protection
against the chill autumn night.</p>

<p>A moment later the soldier-chauffeur mounted
to his seat, and slowly they moved across the
great square and out by the gates, where the sentries
saluted. Then, turning to the right, they
were quickly tearing along the highway in the
darkness.</p>

<p>Soon they overtook several closed carriages
of the home-going visitors, and, ascending the
hill, turned from the main road down into a by-road
leading through a wooded valley, which was
a short cut to the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>Part of their way led through the great For&ecirc;t
d'Amblonville, and though Enid's gay chatter
was mostly of the play, the defects in the acting
and the several amusing <i>contretemps</i> which had
occurred behind the scenes, her companion's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
thoughts were constantly of that stranger whose
brow was so deeply lined with care.</p>

<p>They expected to overtake Sir Hugh in the
brougham, but so long had Enid been changing
her gown that they saw nothing of the others.</p>

<p>Just, however, as they were within a hundred
yards or so of the gates which gave entrance to
the ch&acirc;teau, and were slowing down in order to
swing into the drive, a man emerged from the
darkness, calling upon the driver to stop, and,
placing himself before the car, held up his hands.</p>

<p>Next instant the figure of a second individual
appeared. Enid uttered a cry of alarm, but the
second man, who wore a hard felt hat and dark
overcoat, reassured her by saying in French:</p>

<p>"Pray do not distress yourself, mademoiselle.
There is no cause for alarm. My friend and I
merely wish to speak for a moment with Monsieur
Le Pontois before he enters his house. For
that reason we have presumed to stop your car."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" demanded Le Pontois
angrily. "Who are you that you should hold us
up like this?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, m'sieur, it would be better if you
descended and escorted mademoiselle as far as
your gates. We wish to speak to you for a moment
upon a little matter which is both urgent
and private."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
"Well, cannot you speak here, now, and let
us proceed?"</p>

<p>"Not before mademoiselle," replied the man.
"It is a confidential matter."</p>

<p>Paul, much puzzled at the curious demeanour
of the strangers, reluctantly handed Enid out,
and walked with her as far as his own gate, telling
her to assure Blanche that he would return
in a few moments, when he had heard what the
men wanted.</p>

<p>"Very well," she laughed. "I'll say nothing.
You can tell her all when you come in."</p>

<p>The girl passed through the gates and up the
gravelled drive to the house, when Le Pontois,
turning upon his heel to return to the car, was
met by the two men, who, he found, had walked
closely behind him.</p>

<p>"You are Paul Le Pontois?" inquired the
elder of the pair brusquely.</p>

<p>"Of course! Why do you ask that?"</p>

<p>"Because it is necessary," was his businesslike
reply. Then he added: "I regret, m'sieur,
that you must consider yourself under arrest by
order of his Excellency the Minister of Justice."</p>

<p>"Arrest!" gasped the unhappy man. "Are
you mad, messieurs?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the man who had spoken.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
"We have merely our duty to perform, and have
travelled from Paris to execute it."</p>

<p>"With what offence am I charged?" Le <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pontais'">Pontois</ins>
demanded.</p>

<p>"Of that we have no knowledge. As agents
of secret police, we are sent here to convey you
for interrogation."</p>

<p>The man under arrest stood dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"But at least you will allow me to say farewell
to my wife and child&mdash;to make excuse to
them for my absence?" he urged.</p>

<p>"I regret that is quite impossible, m'sieur.
Our orders are to make the arrest and to afford
you no opportunity to communicate with anyone."</p>

<p>"But this is cruel, inhuman! His Excellency
never meant that, I am quite sure&mdash;especially
when I am innocent of any crime, as far as I am
aware."</p>

<p>"We can only obey our orders, m'sieur," replied
the man in the dark overcoat.</p>

<p>"Then may I not write a line to my wife, just
one word of excuse?" he pleaded.</p>

<p>The two police agents consulted.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the elder of the pair, who
was the one in authority, "if you wish to scribble
a note, here are paper and pencil." And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
tore a leaf from his notebook and handed it to
the prisoner.</p>

<p>By the light of the head-lamps of the car Paul
scribbled a few hurried words to Blanche: "I
am detained on important business," he wrote.
"I will return to-morrow. My love to you both.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paul</span>."</p>

<p>The detective read it, folded it carefully, and
handed it to his assistant, telling him to go up
to the ch&acirc;teau and deliver it at the servants' entrance.</p>

<p>When he had gone the detective, turning
to the chauffeur, said: "I shall require you to
take us to Verdun."</p>

<p>"This is not my car, m'sieur," replied Paul.
"It belongs to General Molon."</p>

<p>"That does not matter. I will telephone to
him an explanation as soon as we arrive in Verdun.
We may as well enter the car as stand
here."</p>

<p>Paul Le Pontois was about to protest, but
what could he say? The Minister in Paris had
apparently committed some grave error in thus
ordering his arrest. No doubt there would be
confusion, apologies and laughter. So, with a
light heart at the knowledge that he had committed
no offence, he got into the car, and allowed
the polite police agent to seat himself beside him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
The only chagrin he felt was that the chauffeur
had overheard all the conversation. And to
him he said: "Remember, Gallet, of this affair
you know nothing."</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly, m'sieur," was the
wondering soldier's reply.</p>

<p>Then they sat in silence in the darkness until
the hurrying police agent returned, after which
the car sped straight past the ch&acirc;teau on the high
road which led through the deep valley on to the
fortress town of Verdun.</p>

<p>As they passed the ch&acirc;teau Paul Le Pontois
caught a glimpse of its lighted windows and sat
wondering what Blanche would imagine. He
pictured the pleasant supper party and the surprise
that would be expressed at his absence.</p>

<p>How amusing! What incongruity! He was
under arrest!</p>

<p>The car rushed on beneath the precipitous
hill crowned by the great fortress of Haudiomont,
through the narrow gorge&mdash;the road to
Paris.</p>

<p>All three men, seated abreast, were silent
until, at last, the elder of the two police agents
bent and glanced at the clock on the dashboard,
visible by the tiny glow-lamp.</p>

<p>"Half past twelve," he remarked. "The
express leaves Verdun at two twenty-eight."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
"For where?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"For Paris."</p>

<p>"Paris!" he cried. "Are you taking me to
Paris?"</p>

<p>"Those are our orders," was the detective's
quiet response.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h4>THE ORDERS OF HIS EXCELLENCY</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> Paul sat back without a word. Well, he
would hear the extraordinary charge against
him, whatever it might be. And, without speaking,
they travelled on and on, until they at last
entered the Porte St. Paul at Verdun, passed
up the Avenue de la Gare, skirting the Palais
de Justice into the station yard.</p>

<p>As Paul descended they were met by a third
stranger who strolled forward&mdash;a man in a
heavy travelling coat and a soft Homburg hat.</p>

<p>It was the man who had sat behind him
earlier in the evening&mdash;the man with the deep
lines upon his care-worn brow, who had laughed
so heartily&mdash;and who a moment later introduced
himself as Jules Pierrepont, special commissaire
of the Paris S&ucirc;ret&eacute;.</p>

<p>"We have met before?" remarked Paul
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur Le Pontois," replied the
man with a grim smile. "On several occasions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
lately. It has been my duty to keep observation
upon your movements&mdash;acting upon orders
from Monsieur the Prefect of Police."</p>

<p>And together they entered the dark, deserted
station to await the night express for Paris.</p>

<p>Suddenly Paul turned back, saying to the
chauffeur in a low, hard voice: "Gallet, to-morrow
go and tell madame my wife that I am
unexpectedly called to the capital. Tell her&mdash;tell
her that I will write to her. But, at all
hazards, do not let her know the truth that I am
under arrest," he added hoarsely.</p>

<p>"That is understood, monsieur," replied the
man, saluting. "Neither madame nor anyone
else shall know why you have left for Paris."</p>

<p>"I rely upon you," were Paul's parting
words, and, turning upon his heel, he accompanied
the three men who were in waiting.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he sat in a second-class
compartment of the Paris <i>rapide</i> with the three
keen-eyed men who had so swiftly effected his
arrest.</p>

<p>It was apparent to him now that the reason
he had recognised Pierrepont was because that
man had maintained vigilant, yet unobtrusive,
observation upon him during several of the preceding
days, keeping near him in all sorts of
ingenious guises and making inquiries concern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>ing
him&mdash;inquiries instituted for some unexplained
cause by the Paris police.</p>

<p>Bitterly he smiled to himself as he gazed
upon the faces of his three companions, hard
and deep-shadowed beneath the uncertain light.
Presently he made some inquiry of Jules Pierrepont,
who had now assumed commandership of
the party, as to the reason of his arrest.</p>

<p>"I regret, Monsieur Le Pontois," replied
the quiet, affable man, "his Excellency does
not give us reasons. We obey orders&mdash;that is
all."</p>

<p>"But surely there is still, even after the war,
justice in France!" cried Paul in dismay.
"There must be some good reason. One cannot
be thus arrested as a criminal without some
charge against him&mdash;in my case a false one!"</p>

<p>All three men had heard prisoners declare
their innocence many times before, therefore
they merely nodded assent&mdash;it was their usual
habit.</p>

<p>"There is, of course, some charge," remarked
Pierrepont. "But no doubt monsieur
has a perfect answer to it."</p>

<p>"When I know what it is," replied Paul between
his teeth, "then I shall meet it bravely,
and demand compensation for this outrageous
arrest!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
He held his breath, for, with a sinking heart,
he realised for the first time the very fact of a
serious allegation being made against him by
some enemy. If mud is thrown some of it always
sticks. What had all his enthusiasm in
life profited him? Nothing. He bit his lip when
he reflected.</p>

<p>"You have some idea of what is alleged
against me, messieurs," the unhappy man exclaimed
presently, as the roaring train emerged
from a long tunnel. "I see it in your faces.
Indeed, you would not have taken the precaution,
which you did at the moment of my arrest,
of searching me to find firearms. You suspected
that I might make an attempt to take my life."</p>

<p>"Merely our habit," replied Pierrepont with
a slight smile.</p>

<p>"The charge is a grave one&mdash;will you not
admit that?"</p>

<p>"Probably it is&mdash;or we should not all three
have been sent to bring you to Paris," remarked
one of the trio.</p>

<p>"You have had access to my <i>dossier</i>&mdash;I feel
sure you have, monsieur," Paul said, addressing
Pierrepont.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are in error. Monsieur le Ministre
does not afford me that privilege. I am but the
servant of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, and no one regrets more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
than myself the painful duty I have been compelled
to perform to-night. I assure you, Monsieur
Le Pontois, that I entertain much regret
that I have been compelled to drag you away
from your home and family thus, to Paris."</p>

<p>"No apology is needed, mon ami," Paul exclaimed
quickly, well aware that the detective
was merely obeying instructions. "I understand
your position perfectly." Then, glancing
round at his companions, he added: "You may
sleep in peace, messieurs. I give you my word
of honour that I will not attempt to escape.
Why, indeed, should I? I have committed no
wrong!"</p>

<p>One of the men had pulled out a well-worn
notebook and was with difficulty writing down
the prisoner's words&mdash;to be put in evidence
against him. Le Pontois realised that; therefore
his mouth closed with a snap, and, leaning back
in the centre of the carriage, he closed his eyes,
not to sleep, but to think.</p>

<p>Before leaving Verdun he had seen Pierrepont
enter the telegraph bureau&mdash;to dispatch a
message to the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, without a doubt. They
already knew in Paris that he was under arrest,
but at his home they were, happily, still in ignorance.
Poor Blanche was asleep, no doubt, by
that time, he thought, calm in the belief that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
had been delayed and would be home in the early
hours.</p>

<p>The fact that he was actually under arrest he
regarded with more humour than seriousness,
feeling that in the morning explanations would
be made and the blunder rectified.</p>

<p>No more honourable or upright man was
there in France than Paul Le Pontois, and this
order from the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; had held him utterly
speechless and astounded. So he sat there hour
after hour as the <i>rapide</i> roared westward, until
it halted at the great echoing station of Ch&acirc;lons,
where all four entered the buffet and hastily
swallowed their caf&eacute;-au-lait.</p>

<p>Afterwards they resumed their seats, and
the train, with its two long, dusty <i>wagons-lit</i>,
moved onward again, with Paris for its goal.</p>

<p>The prisoner said little. He sat calmly reflecting,
wondering and wondering what possible
charge could be made against him. He had
enemies, as every man had, he knew, but he was
not aware of anyone who could make an allegation
of a character sufficiently grave to warrant
his arrest.</p>

<p>Why had it been forbidden that he should
wish Blanche farewell? There was some reason
for that! He inquired of Pierrepont, who had
treated him with such consideration and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
respect, but the agent of secret police only replied
that in making an arrest of that character
they made it a rule never to allow a prisoner
to communicate with his family.</p>

<p>"There are several reasons for it," he explained.
"One is that very often the prisoner
will make a statement to his wife which he will
afterwards greatly regret. Again, prisoners
have been known to whisper to their wives secret
instructions, to order the destruction of papers
before we can make a domiciliary visit, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you surely will not make a domiciliary
visit to my house?" cried Paul, interrupting.</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"At present we cannot tell," Pierrepont replied.
"It depends upon what instructions we
receive."</p>

<p>"Do you usually make searches?" asked the
prisoner, with visions of his own home being
desecrated and ransacked.</p>

<p>"Yes, we generally do," the commissaire of
police admitted. "As I have explained, it is for
that reason we do not allow a prisoner's wife to
know that he is under arrest."</p>

<p>"But such an action is abominable!" cried
Le Pontois angrily. "That my house should
be turned upside down and searched as though
I were a common thief, a forger, or a coiner is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
beyond toleration. I shall demand full inquiry.
My friend Carlier shall put an interpellation in
the Chamber!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur le Ministre acts upon his own
discretion," the detective replied coldly.</p>

<p>"And by so doing sometimes ruins the prospects
and the lives of some of our best men,"
blurted forth the angry prisoner. It was upon
the tip of his tongue to say much more in condemnation,
but the sight of the man with the
notebook caused him to hesitate.</p>

<p>Every word he uttered now would, he knew,
be turned against him. He was under arrest&mdash;for
some crime that he had not committed.</p>

<p>The other passengers by that night express,
who included a party of English tourists, little
dreamed as they passed up and down the corridor
that the smart, good-looking man who wore
the button of the Legion d'Honneur, and who
sat there with the three quiet, respectable-looking
men, was being conveyed to the capital under
escort&mdash;a man who, by the law of France,
was already condemned, was guilty until he
could prove his own innocence!</p>

<p>In the cold grey of dawn they descended at
last at the great bare Gare de l'Est in Paris.
Paul felt tired, cramped and unshaven, but of
necessity entered a taxi called by one of his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>panions,
and, accompanied by Pierrepont and
the elder of his assistants, was driven along
through the cheerless, deserted streets to the
S&ucirc;ret&eacute;.</p>

<p>As he entered the side door of the ponderous
building the police officer on duty saluted his
escort.</p>

<p>His progress across France had been swift
and secret.</p>

<p>What, he wondered, did the future hold in
store for him?</p>

<p>His lip curled into a smile when they ushered
him into a bare room on the first floor. Two
police officers were placed outside the door, while
two stood within.</p>

<p>Then, turning to the window, which looked
out upon the bare trees of the Place below, he
laughed aloud and made some humorous remark
which caused the men to smile.</p>

<p>But, alas! he knew not the truth. Little did
he dream of the amazing allegation that was to
be made against him!&mdash;little did he dream how
completely the enemies of his father-in-law, the
general, had triumphed!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h4>WALTER GIVES WARNING</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned bright and sunny&mdash;a perfect
autumn morning&mdash;at the pretty Ch&acirc;teau of
L&eacute;rouville.</p>

<p>The message which Blanche had received
after returning had not caused her much consternation.
She supposed that Paul had been
suddenly called away on business. So she had
eaten her supper with her father and Enid and
retired to rest.</p>

<p>When, however, they sat at breakfast&mdash;served
in the English style&mdash;Sir Hugh opened a
letter which lay upon his plate, and at once announced
his intention of returning to London.</p>

<p>"I have to see Hughes, my solicitor, over
Aunt Mary's affairs," he explained suddenly to
Blanche. "That executorship is always an infernal
nuisance."</p>

<p>"But surely you can remain a day or two
longer, Dad?" exclaimed Madame Le Pontois.
"The weather is delightful just now, and I hear
it is too dreadful for words in England."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
"I, too, have to be back to prepare for going
away with Mrs. Caldwell," Enid remarked.</p>

<p>"But surely these solicitors will wait?
There is no great urgency&mdash;there can't be! The
old lady died ten years ago," Blanche exclaimed
as she poured out coffee.</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm extremely sorry," said her
father quietly, "but I must go&mdash;it is imperative."</p>

<p>"Not to-day?"</p>

<p>"I ought to go to-day," he sighed. "Indeed,
I really must&mdash;by the <i>rapide</i> I usually
take. Perhaps I shall alter my route this time,
and go from Conflans to Metz, and home by
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Li&eacute;ge'">Li&egrave;ge</ins> and Brussels. It is about as quick, and
one gets a <i>wagon-lit</i> from Metz. I looked up
the train the other day, and find it leaves Conflans
at a little after six."</p>

<p>"Surely you will remain and say au revoir
to Paul? He'll be so disappointed!" she cried
in dismay.</p>

<p>"My dear, you will make excuses for us. I
must really go, and so must Enid. She had a
letter from Mrs. Caldwell urging her to get
back, as she wants to start abroad for the winter.
The bad weather in England is affecting her, it
seems."</p>

<p>And so, with much regret expressed by little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
Ninette and her mother, Sir Hugh Elcombe and
his stepdaughter went to their rooms to see
about their packing.</p>

<p>Both were puzzled. The sudden appearance
of those strange men out of the darkness had
frightened Enid, but she had said nothing. Perhaps
it was upon some private matter that Paul
had been summoned. Therefore she had preserved
silence, believing with Blanche that at
any moment he might return.</p>

<p>Back in his room, Sir Hugh closed the door,
and, standing in the sunshine by the window,
gazed across the wide valley towards the blue
mists beyond, deep in reflection.</p>

<p>"This curious absence of Paul's forebodes
evil," he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>He had slept little that night, being filled
with strange apprehensions. Though he had
closely questioned Enid, she would not say what
had actually happened. Her explanation was
merely that Paul had been called away by a man
who had met him outside.</p>

<p>The old man sighed, biting his lip. He
cursed himself for his dastardly work, even
though he had been compelled by Weirmarsh
to execute it on pain of exposure and consequent
ruin.</p>

<p>Against his will, against his better nature, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
had been forced to meet the mysterious doctor
of Pimlico in secret on that quiet, wooded by-road
between Marcheville and Saint-Hilaire,
four kilom&egrave;tres from the ch&acirc;teau, and there discuss
with him the suggested affair of which they
had spoken in London.</p>

<p>The two men had met at sundown.</p>

<p>"You seem to fear exposure!" laughed the
man who provided Sir Hugh with his comfortable
income. "Don't be foolish&mdash;there is no
danger. Return to England with Enid as soon
as you possibly can without arousing suspicion,
and I will call and see you at Hill Street. I
want to have a very serious chat with you."</p>

<p>Elcombe's grey, weather-worn face grew
hard and determined.</p>

<p>"Why are you here, Weirmarsh?" he demanded.
"I have helped you and your infernal
friends in the past, but please do not count upon
my assistance in the future. Remember that
from to-day our friendship is entirely at an end."</p>

<p>"As you wish, of course, my dear Sir
Hugh," replied the other, with a nonchalant air.
"But if I were you I would not be in too great
a hurry to make such a declaration. You may
require a friend in the near future&mdash;a friend
like myself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
"Never, I hope&mdash;never!" snapped the old
general.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the doctor, who, with
a shrug of his shoulders, wished his friend a cold
adieu and, turning, strode away.</p>

<p>As Sir Hugh stood alone by the window that
morning he recalled every incident of that hateful
interview, every word that had fallen from
the lips of the man who seemed to be as ingenious
and resourceful as Satan himself.</p>

<p>His anxiety regarding Paul's sudden absence
had caused him to invent an excuse for his
own hurried departure. He was not prepared
to remain there and witness his dear daughter's
grief and humiliation, so he deemed it wiser to
get away in safety to England, for he no longer
trusted Weirmarsh. Suppose the doctor revealed
the actual truth by means of some anonymous
communication?</p>

<p>As he stood staring blankly across the valley
he heard the hum of an approaching motor-car,
and saw that it was General Molon's, being
driven by Gallet, the soldier chauffeur.</p>

<p>There was no passenger, but the car entered
the iron gates and pulled up before the door.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Blanche ran up the
stairs and, bursting into her father's room, cried:
"Paul has been called suddenly to Paris, Dad!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
He told Gallet to come this morning and tell me.
How strange that he did not come in to get even
a valise!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said her father. "Gallet is
downstairs, isn't he? I'll speak to him. The
mystery of Paul's absence increases!"</p>

<p>"It does. I&mdash;I can't get rid of a curious
feeling of apprehension that something has happened.
What was there to prevent him from
coming in to wish me good-bye when he was
actually at the gate?"</p>

<p>Sir Hugh went below and questioned the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>The story told by the man Gallet was that
Le Pontois had been met by two gentlemen and
given a message that he was required urgently
in Paris, and they had driven at once over to
Verdun, where they had just caught the train.</p>

<p>"Did Monsieur Le Pontois leave any other
message for madame?" asked Sir Hugh in
French.</p>

<p>"No, m'sieur."</p>

<p>The general endeavoured by dint of persuasion
to learn something more, but the man
was true to his promise, and would make no
further statement. Indeed, earlier that morning
he had been closely questioned by the commandant,
but had been equally reticent. Le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
Pontois was a favourite in the neighbourhood,
and no man would dare to lift his voice against
him.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh returned to his room and commenced
packing his suit-cases, more than ever
convinced that suspicion had been aroused.
Jean came to offer to assist, but he declared that
he liked to pack himself, and this occupied him
the greater part of the morning.</p>

<p>Enid was also busy with her dresses, assisted
by Blanche's Proven&ccedil;al maid, Louise. About
eleven o'clock, however, Jean tapped at her door
and said: "A peasant from Allamont, across
the valley, has brought a letter, mademoiselle.
He says an English gentleman gave it to him
to deliver to you personally. He is downstairs."</p>

<p>In surprise the girl hurriedly descended to
the servants' entrance, where she found a sturdy,
old, grey-bearded peasant, bearing a long, stout
stick. He raised his frayed cap politely and
asked whether she were Mademoiselle Orlebar.</p>

<p>Then, when she had replied in the affirmative,
he drew from the breast of his blouse a
crumpled letter, saying: "The Englishman who
has been staying at the Lion d'Or at Allamont
gave this to me at dawn to-day. I was to give
it only into mademoiselle's hands. There is no
reply."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
Enid tore open the letter eagerly and found
the following words, written hurriedly in pencil
in Walter Fetherston's well-known scrawling
hand&mdash;for a novelist's handwriting is never of
the best:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Make excuse and induce your father to
leave Conflans-Jarny at once for Metz, travelling
by Belgium for London. Accompany him.
A serious <i>contretemps</i> has occurred which will
affect you both if you do not leave immediately
on receipt of this. Heed this, I beg of you.
And remember, I am still your friend.</p>

<p class="figright">"<span class="smcap">Walter.</span>"</p></div>

<p>For a moment she stood puzzled. "Did the
Englishman say there was no reply?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle. He left the Lion d'Or
just before eight, and drove into Conflans with
his luggage. The innkeeper told me that he is
returning suddenly to England. He received
several telegrams in the night, it appears."</p>

<p>"You know him, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, mademoiselle. He came there to
fish in the Longeau, and I have been with him
on several occasions."</p>

<p>Enid took a piece of "cent sous" from her
purse and gave it to the old man, then she returned
to her room and, sending Louise below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
for something, burned Walter's letter in the
grate.</p>

<p>Afterwards she went to her stepfather and
suggested that perhaps they might leave Conflans
earlier than he had resolved.</p>

<p>"I hear there is a train at three-five. If we
went by that," she said, "we could cross from
Ostend instead of by Antwerp, and thus be in
London a day earlier."</p>

<p>"Are you so anxious to get away from here,
Enid?" he asked, looking straight into her face.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. Mother, in her letter yesterday,
urged me to come home, as she does not wish
me to travel out alone to join Mrs. Caldwell.
She's afraid she will leave London without me if
I don't get home at once. Besides, I've got a
lot of shopping to do before I can start. Do let
us get away by the earlier train. It will be so
much better," she urged.</p>

<p>As Sir Hugh never denied Enid anything,
he acquiesced. Packing was speedily concluded,
and, much to the regret of Blanche, the pair left
in a fly for which they had telephoned to Conflans-Jarny.</p>

<p>The train by which they travelled ran
through the beautiful valley of Manvaux, past
the great forts of Plappeville and St. Quentin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
and across the Moselle to Metz, and so into German
territory.</p>

<p>Whatever might happen, Sir Hugh reflected,
at least he was now safe from arrest.
While Enid, on her part, sat back in the corner
of the first-class compartment gazing out of the
window, still mystified by that strange warning
from the man who only a few days previously
had so curiously turned and abandoned her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h4>THE ACCUSERS</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the same hour when Enid and Sir Hugh
were passing Amanvilliers, once the scene of
terrible atrocities by the Huns, Paul Le Pontois,
between two agents of police, was ushered
into the private cabinet where, at the great writing-table
near the window, sat a short man with
bristling hair and snow-white moustache, Monsieur
Henri B&eacute;zard, chief of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale.</p>

<p>A keen-faced, black-eyed man of dapper
appearance, wearing the coveted button of the
L&eacute;gion d'Honneur in his black frock-coat, he
looked up sharply at the man brought into his
presence, wished him a curt "bon jour," and
motioned him to a seat at the opposite side of the
big table, in such a position that the grey light
from the long window fell directly upon his
countenance.</p>

<p>With him, standing about the big, handsome
room with its green-baize doors and huge oil
paintings on the walls, were four elderly men,
strangers to Paul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
The severe atmosphere of that sombre apartment,
wherein sat the chief of the police of the
Republic, was depressing. Those present
moved noiselessly over the thick Turkey carpet,
while the double windows excluded every sound
from the busy boulevard below.</p>

<p>"Your name," exclaimed the great B&eacute;zard
sharply, at last raising his eyes from a file of
papers before him&mdash;"your name is Paul Robert
Le Pontois, son of Paul Le Pontois, rentier of
Severac, Department of Aveyron. During the
war you were captain in the 114th Regiment of
Artillery, and you now reside with your wife
and daughter at the Ch&acirc;teau of L&eacute;rouville. Are
those details correct?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, m'sieur," replied the man seated
with the two police agents standing behind him.
He wore his black evening trousers and a brown
tweed jacket which one of the detectives had
lent him.</p>

<p>"You have been placed under arrest by order
of the Ministry," replied B&eacute;zard, speaking
in his quick, impetuous way.</p>

<p>"I am aware of that, m'sieur," was Paul's
reply, "but I am in ignorance of the charge
against me."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed B&eacute;zard very gravely,
again referring to the formidable <i>dossier</i> before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
him, "the charge brought against you is most
serious. It is astounding and disgraceful. Listen,
and I will read it. Afterwards we will hear
what explanation you have to offer. We are
assembled for that purpose."</p>

<p>The four other men had taken chairs near
by, while Pierrepont was standing at some distance
away, with his back to the wood fire.</p>

<p>For a second B&eacute;zard paused, then, rubbing
his gold pince-nez and adjusting them, he read
in a cold, hard voice the following:</p>

<p>"The charge alleged against you, Paul Robert
Le Pontois, is that upon four separate occasions
you have placed in circulation forged Bank
of England and Treasury notes of England to
the extent of nearly a million francs."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried Paul, jumping to his feet,
his face aflame. "Before God, I swear it is
a lie!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself and listen," commanded the
great chief of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale sharply.
"Be seated."</p>

<p>The prisoner sank back into his chair again.
His head was reeling. Who could possibly have
made such unfounded charges against him? He
could scarcely believe his ears.</p>

<p>Then the hard-faced, white-headed old director,
who held supreme command of the police<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
of the Republic, glanced at him shrewdly, and,
continuing, said: "It is alleged that you, Paul
Le Pontois, on the fourteenth day of January,
and again on the sixteenth of May, met in Commercy
a certain Englishman, and handed to him
a bundle of English notes since proved to be
forgeries."</p>

<p>"I am not acquainted with any English
forger," protested Paul.</p>

<p>"Do not interrupt, m'sieur!" snapped the
director. "You will, later on, be afforded full
opportunity to make any statement or explanation
you may wish. First listen to these grave
charges against you." After a further pause,
he added: "The third occasion, it is alleged, was
on April the eighth last, when it seems you drove
at early morning over to Thillot-sous-les-C&ocirc;tes
and there met a stranger who was afterwards
identified as an American who is wanted for
banknote forgeries."</p>

<p>"And the fourth?" asked Paul hoarsely.
This string of allegations utterly staggered him.</p>

<p>"The fourth occasion was quite recently,"
B&eacute;zard said, still speaking in that same cold
tone. "On that occasion you made certain calculations
to ascertain how much were your
profits by dealing with these forgers whom Scotland
Yard are so anxious to arrest. You wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
all the sums down, knowing your expenditure
and profits. The latter were very considerable."</p>

<p>"And by whom is it alleged that I am a
dealer in base money, pray?"</p>

<p>"It is not necessary for us to disclose the
name of our informant," was the stiff rejoinder.</p>

<p>"But surely I am not to be thus denounced
by an anonymous enemy?" he cried. "This is
not the justice which every Frenchman claims
as his birthright!"</p>

<p>"You have demanded to know the charges
laid against you, and I have detailed them,"
replied the chief of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, regarding the
prisoner closely through his gold pince-nez.</p>

<p>"They are false&mdash;every word of them,"
promptly returned Le Pontois. "I have no acquaintance
with any banknote forger. If I had,
he would quickly find himself under arrest."</p>

<p>The four men seated in his vicinity smiled
grimly. They had expected the prisoner to declare
his innocence.</p>

<p>"I may tell you that the information here"&mdash;and
B&eacute;zard tapped the <i>dossier</i> before him&mdash;"is
from a source in which we have the most
complete and implicit confidence. For the past
few months there have been suspicions that
forged English notes have been put into circulation
in France. Therefore I ordered a vigilant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>
watch to be maintained. Monsieur Pierrepont,
here, has been in command of a squadron of confidential
agents."</p>

<p>"And they have watched me, and, I suppose,
have manufactured evidence against me!
It is only what may be expected of men paid
to spy upon us. If I am a forger or a friend of
forgers, as you allege me to be, then I am unworthy
to have served in the uniform of France.
But I tell you that the allegations you have just
read are lies&mdash;lies, every word of them." And
Le Pontois' pale cheeks flushed crimson with
anger.</p>

<p>"Le Pontois," remarked a tall, thin, elderly
commissaire who was present, "it is for you to
prove your innocence. The information laid before
us is derived from those who have daily
watched your movements and reported them.
If you can prove to us that it is false, then your
innocence may be established."</p>

<p>"But I <i>am</i> innocent!" he protested, "therefore
I have no fear what charges may be laid
against me. They cannot be substantiated.
The whole string of allegations is utterly
ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Eh bien! Then let us commence with the
first," exclaimed B&eacute;zard, again referring to the
file of secret reports before him. "On Wednes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>day,
the fourteenth day of January, you went to
Commercy, where, at the Caf&eacute; de la Cloche, you
met a certain Belgian who passed under the
name of Laloux."</p>

<p>"I recollect!" cried Le Pontois quickly. "I
sold him a horse. He was a dealer."</p>

<p>"A dealer in forged notes," remarked one
of the officials, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Was he a forger, then?" asked Le Pontois
in entire surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. He has entered France several times
in the guise of a horsedealer," Pierrepont interrupted.</p>

<p>"But I only bought a horse of him," declared
the prisoner vehemently.</p>

<p>"And you paid for it in English notes,
apologising that you had no other money. He
took them, for he passed them in Belgium into
an English bank in Brussels. They were
forged!"</p>

<p>"Again, on the sixteenth of May, you met
the man Laloux at the same place," said B&eacute;zard.</p>

<p>"He had a mare to sell&mdash;I tried to buy it
for my wife to drive, but he wanted too much."</p>

<p>"You remained the night at the H&ocirc;tel de
Paris, and saw him again at nine o'clock next
morning."</p>

<p>"True. I hoped to strike a bargain with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
him in the morning, but we could not come to
terms."</p>

<p>"Regarding the forged English notes you
were prepared to sell, eh?" snapped B&eacute;zard,
with a look of disbelief.</p>

<p>"I had nothing to sell!" protested Le Pontois,
drawing himself up. "Those who have
spied upon me have told untruths."</p>

<p>"But the individual, Laloux, was watched.
One of our agents followed him to Brussels,
where he went next day to the English bank in
the Montagne de la Cour."</p>

<p>"Not with forged notes from me. My dealings
with him were in every way honest business
transactions."</p>

<p>"You mean that you received money from
him, eh?"</p>

<p>"I do not deny that. I sold him a horse on
the first occasion. He paid me seven hundred
francs for it, and I afterwards purchased one
from him."</p>

<p>"So you do not deny that you received
money from that man?"</p>

<p>"Why should I? I sold him a horse, and he
paid me for it."</p>

<p>"Very well," said B&eacute;zard, with some hesitation.
"Let us pass to the eighth of April. At
six o'clock that morning you drove to Thillot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>-sous-les-C&ocirc;tes,
where you met a stranger at the
entrance to the village, and walked with him,
and held a long and earnest conversation."</p>

<p>Paul was silent for a moment. The incident
recalled was one that he would fain have forgotten,
one the truth of which he intended at
all hazards to conceal.</p>

<p>"I admit that I went to Thillot in secret,"
he answered in a changed voice.</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you do not deny that you were
attracted by the promises of substantial payment
for certain forged English notes which you
could furnish, eh?" grunted B&eacute;zard in satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I admit going to Thillot, but I deny your
allegation," cried Paul in quick protest.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will tell us the reason
you took that early drive?" asked a commissaire,
with a short, hard laugh of disbelief.</p>

<p>The prisoner hesitated. It was a purely
personal matter, one which concerned himself
alone.</p>

<p>"I regret, messieurs," was his slow reply,
"I regret that I am unable&mdash;indeed, I am not
permitted to answer that question."</p>

<p>"Pray why?" inquired B&eacute;zard.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;because it concerns a woman's hon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>our,"
was the low, hoarse reply, "the honour
of the wife of a certain officer."</p>

<p>At those words of his the men interrogating
him laughed in derision, declaring it to be a very
elegant excuse.</p>

<p>"It is no excuse!" he cried fiercely, again
rising from his chair. "When I have obtained
permission to speak, messieurs, I will tell you
the truth. Until then I shall remain silent."</p>

<p>"Eh, bien!" snapped B&eacute;zard. "And so
we will pass to the next and final charge&mdash;that
you prepared a statement in order to satisfy
yourself regarding the profits of your dealings
in these spurious notes."</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge of such a thing!"
Paul replied instantly.</p>

<p>"And yet for several weeks past a mysterious
friend of yours has been seen in the neighbourhood
of your ch&acirc;teau. He has been staying
in Commercy and in Longuyon. I gave orders
for his arrest, but, with his usual cleverness, he
escaped from Commercy."</p>

<p>"I prepared no statement."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted B&eacute;zard, looking straight
into his flushed face. "You are quite certain
of that?"</p>

<p>"I swear I did not."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you will deny that this is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
your hand?" the director asked slowly, with a
grin, as he fixed his eyes upon Paul and handed
him a sheet of his own note-paper bearing the
address of the ch&acirc;teau embossed in green.</p>

<p>Paul took it in his trembling fingers, and as
he did so his countenance fell.</p>

<p>It was the rough account of his investments
and profits he remembered making for his
father-in-law. He had cast it unheeded into the
waste-paper basket, whence it had, no doubt,
been recovered by those who had spied upon him
and placed with the reports as evidence against
him.</p>

<p>"You admit making that calculation?"
asked B&eacute;zard severely. "Those figures are, I believe,
in your handwriting?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I have had nothing to do with
any forgers of banknotes," declared the unhappy
man, reseating himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! Then you admit making the calculation?
That in itself is sufficient for the present.
However, cannot you give us some explanation
of that secret visit of yours to Thillot? Remember,
you have to prove your innocence!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot&mdash;not, at least, at present,"
faltered the prisoner.</p>

<p>"You refuse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'sieur, I flatly refuse," was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
hoarse reply. "As I have told you, that visit
concerned the honour of a woman."</p>

<p>The men again exchanged glances of disbelief,
while the victim of those dastardly allegations
sat breathless, amazed at the astounding
manner in which his most innocent actions had
been misconstrued into incriminating evidence.</p>

<p>He was under arrest as one who had placed
forged English banknotes in circulation in
France!</p>

<h4>IN WHICH A TRUTH IS HIDDEN</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Walter Fetherston entered the tasteful
drawing-room at Hill Street four days later he
found Enid alone, seated by the fire.</p>

<p>The dull London light of the autumn afternoon
was scarcely sufficient for him to distinguish
every object in the apartment, but as he
advanced she rose and stood silhouetted against
the firelight, a slight, graceful figure, with hand
outstretched.</p>

<p>"Both mother and Sir Hugh are out&mdash;gone
to a matin&eacute;e at the Garrick," she exclaimed.
"I'm so glad you've come in," and she placed
a chair for him.</p>

<p>"I have heard that you are leaving for
Egypt to-morrow," he said, "and I wished to
have a chat with you."</p>

<p>"We go to Italy first, and to Egypt after
Christmas," she replied. "Mother has promised
to join us in Luxor at the end of January."</p>

<p>"If I were you, Enid," he replied gravely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
bending towards her, "I would make some excuse
and remain in England."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, her eyes opening widely.
"I don't understand!"</p>

<p>"I regret that I am unable to speak more
plainly," he said. "I warned you to leave
France, and I was glad that you and Sir Hugh
heeded my warning. Otherwise&mdash;well, perhaps
an unpleasant incident would have resulted."</p>

<p>"You always speak in enigmas nowadays,"
said the girl, again standing near the fireplace,
dainty in her dark skirt and cream silk jumper.
"Why did you send me that extraordinary
note?"</p>

<p>"In your own interests," was his vague reply.
"I became aware that your further presence
in the house of Monsieur Le Pontois was&mdash;well&mdash;undesirable&mdash;that's
all."</p>

<p>"I really think you entertain some antagonism
against Paul," she declared, "yet he's such
a good fellow."</p>

<p>The novelist's eyes sparkled through his
pince-nez as he replied: "He's very good-looking,
I admit, and, no doubt, a perfect cavalier."</p>

<p>"You suspect me of flirtations with him, of
course," she pouted. "Well, you're not the first
man who has chaffed me about that."</p>

<p>"No, no," he laughed. "I'm in no way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
jealous, I assure you. I merely told you that
your departure from the ch&acirc;teau would be for
the best."</p>

<p>He did not tell her that within an hour of
their leaving French territory an official telegram
had been received from Paris by the local
commissaire of police with orders to detain them
both, nor that just before dark an insignificant-looking
man in black had called at the ch&acirc;teau
and been informed by Jean that the English
general and his stepdaughter had already departed.</p>

<p>The whole of that night the wires between
the sous-prefecture at Briey and Paris had been
at work, and many curious official messages had
been exchanged. Truly, the pair had had a
providential escape.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh was, of course, in entire ignorance
of the dastardly action taken by the Pimlico
doctor.</p>

<p>Without duly counting the cost, he had declared
at his last interview with Weirmarsh that
their criminal partnership was now at an end.
And the doctor had taken him at his word.</p>

<p>Had not the doctor in London told his assistant,
Heureux, that Sir Hugh's sphere of
usefulness was at an end, and that, in all probability,
a <i>contretemps</i> would occur&mdash;one which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
would in future save to "the syndicate" the sum
of five thousand pounds per annum?</p>

<p>Truth to tell, B&eacute;zard, director of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;,
had telegraphed orders for the arrest of Sir Hugh
and his daughter. But, thanks to the shrewdness
of Fetherston, who had lingered in the
vicinity to afford them protection if necessary,
they had succeeded in escaping only a single
hour before the message reached its destination.</p>

<p>Neither of them knew of this, and the novelist
intended that they should remain in ignorance&mdash;just
as they were still in ignorance of
the reason of Paul's visit to Paris and of his detention
there.</p>

<p>If they were aware of the reason of his warning,
then they would most certainly question him
as to the manner in which he was able to gain
knowledge of the betrayal by Weirmarsh. He
had no desire to be questioned upon such matters.
The motives of his action&mdash;always swift,
full of shrewd foresight, and often in disregard
of his own personal safety&mdash;were known alone
to himself and to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>If the truth were told, he had not been alone
in Eastern France. At the little old-world
Croix-Blanche at Briey a stout, middle-aged,
ruddy-faced English tourist had had his headquarters;
while, again, at the unpretending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
Cloche d'Or in the Place St. Paul at Verdun
another Englishman, a young, active, clean-shaven
man, had been moving about the country
in constant communication with "Mr. Maltwood."
Wherever the doctor from Pimlico and
his assistant, Heureux, had gone, there also went
one or other of those two sharp-eyed but unobtrusive
Englishmen. Every action of the doctor
had been noted, and information of it conveyed
to the quiet-mannered man in pince-nez.</p>

<p>"Really, Walter, you are quite as mysterious
as your books," Enid was declaring, with a
laugh. "I do wish you would satisfy my curiosity
and tell me why you urged me to leave
France so suddenly."</p>

<p>"I had reasons&mdash;strong reasons which you
may, perhaps, some day know," was his response.
"I am only glad that you thought fit
to take the advice I offered. This afternoon I
have called to give you further advice&mdash;namely,
to remain in England, at least for the present."</p>

<p>"But I can't. My friend Jane Caldwell has
been waiting a whole fortnight for me, suffering
from asthma in these abominable fogs."</p>

<p>"You can make some excuse. I assure you
that to remain in London will be for the best,"
he said, while she switched on the shaded electric
lights, which shed a soft glow over the handsome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
room&mdash;that apartment, the costly furniture of
which had been purchased out of the money secretly
supplied by Weirmarsh.</p>

<p>"But I can't see why I should remain," she
protested, facing him again. He noted how
strikingly handsome she was, her dimpled cheeks
delicately moulded and her pretty chin slightly
protruding, which gave a delightful piquancy to
her features.</p>

<p>"I wish I could explain further. I can't at
present!"</p>

<p>"You are, as I have already said, so amazingly
mysterious&mdash;so full of secrets always!"</p>

<p>The man sighed, his brows knit slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I am full of secrets&mdash;strange,
astounding secrets they are&mdash;secrets
which some time, if divulged, would mean terrible
complications, ruin to those who are believed
to be honest and upright."</p>

<p>The girl stood for a few seconds in silence.</p>

<p>She had heard strange rumours regarding
the man seated there before her. Some had
hinted that he, on more than one occasion, acting
in an unofficial capacity, had arranged important
treaties between Great Britain and a
foreign Power, leaving to ambassadors the arrangements
of detail and the final ratification.
There were whispers abroad that he was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
trusted and tried agent of the British Government,
but in exactly what capacity was unknown.
His name frequently appeared among the invited
guests of Cabinet Ministers, and he received
cards for many official functions, but the
actual manner in which he rendered assistance
to the Government was always kept a most profound
secret.</p>

<p>More than once Sir Hugh had mentioned
the matter over the dining-table, expressing
wonder as to Fetherston's real position.</p>

<p>"You know him well, Enid," he had exclaimed
once, laughing over to her. "What is
your opinion?"</p>

<p>"I really haven't any," she declared. "His
movements are certainly rapid, and often most
mysterious."</p>

<p>"He's a most excellent fellow," declared the
old general. "Cartwright told me so the other
day in the club. Cartwright was ambassador
in Petrograd before the war."</p>

<p>Enid remembered this as she stood there, her
hands behind her back.</p>

<p>"Before I left I heard that Paul had been
called unexpectedly to Paris," he said a few moments
later. "Has he returned?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, I believe. I had a letter from
Blanche this morning. When it was written,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
two days ago, he was still absent." Then she
added: "There is some mystery regarding his
visit to the capital. Blanche left for Paris yesterday,
I believe, for she had telegraphed to him,
but received no reply."</p>

<p>"She has gone to Paris!" he echoed. "Why
did she go? It was silly!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;because she is puzzled, I think. It
was very strange that Paul, even though at the
very gate, did not leave those two men and wish
her adieu."</p>

<p>"Two men&mdash;what two men?" he asked in
affected ignorance.</p>

<p>"The two men who stopped the car and demanded
to speak with him," she said; and, continuing,
described to him that remarkable midnight
incident close to the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>"No doubt he went to Paris upon some important
business," Fetherston said, reassuring
her. "It was, I think, foolish of his wife to follow.
At least, that's my opinion."</p>

<p>He knew that when madame arrived in Paris
the ghastly truth must, sooner or later, be revealed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h4>IN WHICH A TRUTH IS TOLD</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Fetherston sat there, still chatting with his
well-beloved, he felt a hatred of himself for being
thus compelled to deceive her&mdash;to withhold
from her the hideous truth of Paul's arrest.</p>

<p>After all, silence was best. If Walter spoke
to the girl before him, then he must of necessity
reveal his own connection with the affair. He
knew she had been puzzled by his presence in
France, but his explanation, he hoped, had been
sufficient. He had assured her that the <i>only</i> motive
of his journey had been to be near her,
which was, indeed, no untruth.</p>

<p>He saw that Enid was not altogether at her
ease in his presence. Perhaps it was because of
those questions and his plain outspokenness
when last they met, on that forest road, where
they had discussed the strange death of Harry
Bellairs.</p>

<p>On that evening, full of suspicion and apprehension,
he had decided to tear himself away
from her. But, alas! he had found himself
powerless to do so. Pity and sympathy filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
his heart; therefore, how could he turn from
her and abandon her at this moment of her peril?
It was on the next day that he had discerned
Weirmarsh's sinister intentions. Therefore, he
had risen to watch and to combat them.</p>

<p>Some of his suspicions had been confirmed,
nevertheless his chief object had not yet been
attained&mdash;the elucidation of the mystery surrounding
the remarkable death of Bellairs.</p>

<p>He was about to refer again to that tragic
incident when Enid said suddenly: "Doctor
Weirmarsh called and saw Sir Hugh this morning.
You told me to tell you when next he
called."</p>

<p>"Weirmarsh!" exclaimed the novelist in
surprise. "I was not aware that he was in
London!"</p>

<p>"He's been abroad&mdash;in Copenhagen, I
think. He has a brother living there."</p>

<p>"He had a private talk with your stepfather,
of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as usual, they were in the study for
quite a long time&mdash;nearly two hours. And,"
added the girl, "I believe that at last they quarrelled.
If they have, I'm awfully glad, for I
hate that man!"</p>

<p>"Did you overhear them?" asked Fetherston
anxiously, apprehensive lest an open quar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>rel
had actually taken place. He knew well that
Josef Blot, alias Weirmarsh, was not a man to
be trifled with. If Sir Hugh had served his purpose,
as he no doubt had, then he would be betrayed
to the police without compunction, just
as others had been.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston grew much perturbed at
the knowledge of this quarrel between the pair.
His sole aim was to protect Sir Hugh, yet how
to act he knew not.</p>

<p>"You did not actually hear any of the words
spoken, I suppose?" he inquired of Enid.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, except that I heard my stepfather
denounce the doctor as an infernal cur
and blackguard."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did Weirmarsh reply?"</p>

<p>"He threatened Sir Hugh, saying, 'You
shall suffer for those words&mdash;you, who owe
everything to me!' I wonder," added the girl,
"what he meant by that?"</p>

<p>"Who knows!" exclaimed Walter. "Some
secret exists between them. You told me that
you suspected it long ago."</p>

<p>"And I do," she said, lowering her voice.
"That man holds Sir Hugh in the hollow of his
hand&mdash;of that I'm sure. I have noticed after
each of the doctor's visits how pale and thoughtful
he always is."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
"Have you tried to learn the reason of it
all?" inquired the novelist quietly, his gaze fixed
upon her.</p>

<p>"I have," she replied, with slight hesitation.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston contemplated in silence
the fine cat's-eye and diamond ring upon his
finger&mdash;a ring sent him long ago by an anonymous
admirer of his books, which he had ever
since worn as a mascot.</p>

<p>At one moment he held this girl in distinct
suspicion; at the next, however, he realised her
peril, and resolved to stand by her as her champion.</p>

<p>Did he really and honestly love her? He
put that question to himself a thousand times.
And for the thousandth time was he compelled
to answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"By which route do you intend travelling to
Italy to-morrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By Paris and Modane. We go first for a
week to Nervi, on the coast beyond Genoa," was
her reply.</p>

<p>Fetherston paused. If she put foot in
France she would, he knew, be at once placed
under arrest as an accomplice of Paul Le Pontois.
When Weirmarsh took revenge he always
did his work well. No doubt the French police
were already at Calais awaiting her arrival.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
"I would change the route," he suggested.
"Go by Ostend, Strasburg and Milan."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Caldwell has already taken our
tickets," she said. "Besides, it is a terribly long
way round by that route."</p>

<p>"I know," he murmured. "But it will be
best. I have a reason&mdash;a strong reason, Enid,
for urging you to go by Ostend."</p>

<p>"It is not in my power to do so. Jane always
makes our travelling arrangements. Besides,
we have sleeping berths secured on the
night <i>rapide</i> from the Gare de Lyon to Turin."</p>

<p>"I will see Mrs. Caldwell, and get her tickets
changed," he said. "Do you understand, Enid?
There are reasons&mdash;very strong reasons&mdash;why
you should not travel across France!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," declared the girl. "You are
mysterious again. Why don't you be open with
me and give me your reasons for this suggestion?"</p>

<p>"I would most willingly&mdash;if I could," he answered.
"Unfortunately, I cannot."</p>

<p>"I don't think Mrs. Caldwell will travel by
the roundabout route which you suggest merely
because you have a whim that we should not
cross France," she remarked, looking straight
at him.</p>

<p>"If you enter France a disaster will happen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>&mdash;depend
upon it," he said, speaking very
slowly, his eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"Are you a prophet?" the girl asked.
"Can you prophesy dreadful things to happen
to us?"</p>

<p>"I do in this case," he said firmly. "Therefore,
take my advice and do not court disaster."</p>

<p>"Can't you be more explicit?" she asked,
much puzzled by his strange words.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, shaking his head, "I
cannot. I only forewarn you of what must happen.
Therefore, I beg of you to take my advice
and travel by the alternative route&mdash;if you really
must go to Italy."</p>

<p>She turned towards the fire and, fixing her
gaze upon the flames, remained for a few moments
in thought, one neat foot upon the marble
kerb.</p>

<p>"You really alarm me with all these serious
utterances," she said at last, with a faint, nervous
laugh.</p>

<p>He rose and stood by her side.</p>

<p>"Look here, Enid," he said, "can't you see
that I am in dead earnest? Have I not already
declared that I am your friend, to assist you
against that man Weirmarsh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "you have."</p>

<p>"Then will you not heed my warning?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
There is distinct danger in your visit to France&mdash;a
danger of which you have no suspicion, but
real and serious nevertheless. Don't think about
spying; it is not that, I assure you."</p>

<p>"How can I avoid it?"</p>

<p>"By pretending to be unwell," he suggested
quickly. "You cannot leave with Mrs. Caldwell.
Let her go, and you can join her a few
days later, travelling by Ostend. The thing is
quite simple."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you must not hesitate," he declared.
"There are no buts. It is the only way."</p>

<p>"Yes; but tell me what terrible thing is to
happen to me if I enter France?" she asked,
with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>The man hesitated. To speak the truth
would be to explain all. Therefore he only
shook his head and said, "Please do not ask me
to explain a matter of which I am not permitted
to speak. If you believe me, Enid," he said in
a low, pleading voice, "do heed my warning, I
beg of you!"</p>

<p>As he uttered these words the handle of the
door turned, and Lady Elcombe, warmly clad in
furs, came forward to greet the novelist.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad that I returned before you left,
Mr. Fetherston," she exclaimed. "We've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
to a most dreary play; and I'm simply dying
for some tea. Enid, ring the bell, dear, will
you?" Then continuing, she added in warm
enthusiasm: "Really, Mr. Fetherston, you are
quite a stranger! We hoped to see more of you,
but my husband and daughter have been away
in France&mdash;as perhaps you know."</p>

<p>"So Enid has been telling me," replied Walter.
"They've been in a most interesting district."</p>

<p>"Enid is leaving us again to-morrow morning,"
remarked her mother. "They are going
to Nervi. You know it, of course, for I've heard
you called the living Baedeker, Mr. Fetherston,"
she laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "I know it&mdash;a rather dull
little place, with one or two villas. I prefer
Santa Margherita, a little farther along the coast&mdash;or
Rapallo. But," he added, "your daughter
tells me she's not well. I hope she will not be
compelled to postpone her departure."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Lady Elcombe decisively.
"She must go to-morrow if she goes
at all. I will not allow her to travel by herself."</p>

<p>The girl and the man exchanged meaning
glances, and just then Sir Hugh himself entered,
greeting his visitor cheerily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
The butler brought in the tea-tray, and as
they sat together the two men chatted.</p>

<p>In pretence that he had not been abroad,
Walter was making inquiry regarding the district
around Haudiomont, which he declared
must be full of interest, and asking the general's
opinion of the French new fortresses in anticipation
of the new war against Germany.</p>

<p>"Since I have been away," said the general,
"I have been forced to arrive at the conclusion
that another danger may arrive in the very near
future. Germany will try and attack France
again&mdash;without a doubt. The French are
labouring under a dangerous delusion if they
suppose that Germany would be satisfied with
her obscurity."</p>

<p>"Is that really your opinion, Sir Hugh?"
asked Fetherston, somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was the general's reply.
"There will be another war in the near future.
My opinions have changed of late, my dear
Fetherston," Sir Hugh assured him, as he sipped
his tea, "and more especially since I went to
visit my daughter. I have recently had opportunities
of seeing and learning a good deal."</p>

<p>Fetherston reflected. Those words, coming
from Sir Hugh, were certainly strange ones.</p>

<p>Walter was handing Enid the cake when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
butler entered, bearing a telegram upon a silver
salver, which he handed to Sir Hugh.</p>

<p>Tearing it open, he glanced at the message
eagerly, and a second later, with blanched face,
stood rigid, statuesque, as though turned into
stone.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" asked his wife.
"Whom is it from?"</p>

<p>"Only from Blanche," he answered in a low,
strained voice. "She is in Paris&mdash;and is leaving
to-night for London."</p>

<p>"Is Paul coming?" inquired Enid eagerly.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, with a strenuous effort
to remain calm. "He&mdash;he cannot leave Paris."</p>

<p>The butler, being told there was no answer,
bowed and withdrew, but a few seconds later the
door reopened, and he announced:</p>

<p>"Dr. Weirmarsh, Sir Hugh!"</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h4>THE WIDENED BREACH</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Sir Hugh entered his cosy study he
found the doctor seated at his ease in the big
chair by the fire.</p>

<p>"I thought that, being in the vicinity, I
would call and see if you've recovered from your&mdash;well,
your silly fit of irritability," he said, with
a grim smile on his grey face as he looked
towards the general.</p>

<p>"I have just received bad news&mdash;news which
I have all along dreaded," replied the unhappy
man, the telegram still in his hand. "Paul Le
Pontois has been arrested on some mysterious
charge&mdash;false, without a doubt!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Weirmarsh; "it is most unfortunate.
I heard it an hour ago, and the real
reason of my visit was to tell you of the <i>contretemps</i>."</p>

<p>"Someone must have made a false charge
against him," cried the general excitedly. "The
poor fellow is innocent&mdash;entirely innocent! I
only have a brief telegram from his wife. She
is in despair, and leaves for London to-night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
"My dear Sir Hugh, France is in a very
hysterical mood just now. Of course, there
must be some mistake. Some private enemy of
his has made the charge without a doubt&mdash;someone
jealous of his position, perhaps. Allegations
are easily made, though not so easily substantiated."</p>

<p>"Except by manufactured evidence and
forged documents," snapped Sir Hugh. "If
Paul is the victim of some political party and
is to be made a scapegoat, then Heaven help
him, poor fellow. They will never allow him to
prove his innocence, unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless I come forward," he said very
slowly, staring straight before him. "Unless
I come forward and tell the truth of my dealings
with you. The charges against Paul are
false. I know it now. What have you to say?"
he added in a low, hard voice.</p>

<p>"A great deal of good that would do!"
laughed Weirmarsh, selecting a cigarette from
his gold case and lighting it, regarding his host
with those narrow-set, sinister eyes of his. "It
would only implicate Le Pontois further. They
would say, and with truth, that you knew of the
whole conspiracy and had profited by it."</p>

<p>"I should tell them what I know concerning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
you. Indeed, I wrote out a full statement while
I was staying with Paul. And I have it ready
to hand for the authorities."</p>

<p>"You can do so, of course, if you choose,"
was the careless reply. "It really doesn't matter
to me what statement you make. You have
always preserved silence up to the present, therefore
I should believe that in this case silence was
still golden."</p>

<p>"And you suggest that I stand calmly by
and see Le Pontois sentenced to a long term of
imprisonment for a crime which he has not committed,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I don't suggest anything, my dear Sir
Hugh," was the man's reply; "I leave it all to
your good judgment."</p>

<p>Since they had met in secret Weirmarsh had
made a flying visit to Brussels, where he had
conferred with two friends of his. Upon their
suggestion he was now acting.</p>

<p>If Paul Le Pontois were secretly denounced
and afterwards found innocent, then it would
only mystify the French police; the policy pursued
towards the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, as well as towards Sir
Hugh, was a clever move on Weirmarsh's part.</p>

<p>"What am I to say to my poor girl when
she arrives here in tears to-morrow?" demanded
the fine old British officer hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
"You know that best yourself," was Weirmarsh's
brusque reply.</p>

<p>"To you I owe all my recent troubles," the
elder man declared. "Because&mdash;because," he
added bitterly, "you bought me up body and
soul."</p>

<p>"A mere business arrangement, wasn't it,
Sir Hugh?" remarked his visitor. "Of course,
I'm very sorry if any great trouble has fallen
upon you on my account. I hope, for instance,
you do not suspect me of conspiring to denounce
your son-in-law," he added.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," was the other's reply;
"yet I feel that, in view of this <i>contretemps</i>, I
must in future break off all connection with
you."</p>

<p>"And lose the annual grant which you find
so extremely useful?"</p>

<p>"I shall be compelled to do without it. And,
at least, I shall have peace of mind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," remarked the other meaningly.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh realised that this man intended
still to hold him in the hollow of his hand. From
that one false step he had taken years ago he had
never been able to draw back.</p>

<p>Hour by hour, and day by day, had his conscience
pricked him. Those chats with the doc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>tor
in that grimy little consulting-room in Pimlico
remained ever in his memory.</p>

<p>The doctor was the representative of those
who held him in their power&mdash;persons who were
being continually hunted by the police, yet who
always evaded them&mdash;criminals all! To insult
him would be to insult those who had paid him so
well for his confidential services.</p>

<p>Yet, filled with contempt for himself, he
asked whether he did not deserve to be degraded
publicly, and drummed out of the army.</p>

<p>Were it not for Lady Elcombe and Enid he
would long ago have gone to East Africa and
effaced himself. But he could not bring himself
to desert them.</p>

<p>He had satisfied himself that not a soul in
England suspected the truth, for, by the Press,
he had long ago been declared to be a patriotic
Briton, because in his stirring public speeches,
when he had put up for Parliament after the
armistice, there was always a genuine "John
Bull" ring.</p>

<p>The truth was that he remained unsuspected
by all&mdash;save by one man who had scented the
truth. That man was Walter Fetherston!</p>

<p>Walter alone knew the ghastly circumstances,
and it was he who had been working to
save the old soldier from himself. He did so for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
two reasons&mdash;first, because he was fond of the
bluff, fearless old fellow, and, secondly, because
he had been attracted by Enid, and intended to
rescue her from the evil thraldom of Weirmarsh.</p>

<p>"Why have you returned here to taunt and
irritate me again?" snapped Sir Hugh after a
pause.</p>

<p>"I came to tell you news which, apparently,
you have already received."</p>

<p>"You could well have kept it. You knew
that I should be informed in due course."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I&mdash;well, I thought you might
grow apprehensive perhaps."</p>

<p>"In what direction?"</p>

<p>"That your connection with the little affair
might be discovered by the French police.
B&eacute;zard, the new chief of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, is a pretty
shrewd person, remember!"</p>

<p>"But, surely, that is not possible, is it?"
gasped the elder man in quick alarm.</p>

<p>"No; you can reassure yourself on that
point. Le Pontois knows nothing, therefore he
can make no statement&mdash;unless, of course, your
own actions were suspicious."</p>

<p>"They were not&mdash;I am convinced of that."</p>

<p>"Then you have no need to fear. Your son-in-law
will certainly not endeavour to implicate
you. And if he did, he would not be believed,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
declared the doctor, although he well knew that
B&eacute;zard was in possession of full knowledge of
the whole truth, and that, only by the timely
warning he had so mysteriously received, had
this man before him and his stepdaughter escaped
arrest.</p>

<p>His dastardly plot to secure their ruin and
imprisonment had failed. How the girl had obtained
wind of it utterly mystified him. It was
really in order to discover the reason of their
sudden flight that he had made those two visits.</p>

<p>"Look here, Weirmarsh," exclaimed Sir
Hugh with sudden resolution, "I wish you to
understand that from to-day, once and for all,
I desire to have no further dealings with you.
It was, as you have said, a purely business transaction.
Well, I have done the dirty, disgraceful
work for which you have paid me, and now my
task is at an end."</p>

<p>"I hardly think it is, my dear Sir Hugh,"
replied the doctor calmly. "As I have said before,
I am only the mouthpiece&mdash;I am not the
employer. But I believe that certain further
assistance is required&mdash;information which you
promised long ago, but failed to procure."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"You recollect that you promised to obtain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
something&mdash;a little tittle-tattle&mdash;concerning a
lady."</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped the old officer, "oh, Lady
Wansford. Let us talk of something else!"</p>

<p>Weirmarsh, who had been narrowly watching
the countenance of his victim, saw that he
had mentioned a disagreeable subject. He
noted how pale were the general's cheeks, and
how his thin hands twitched with suppressed
excitement.</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to talk of other matters,"
he answered, "though I deem it but right to refer
to my instructions."</p>

<p>"And what are they?"</p>

<p>"To request you to supply the promised information."</p>

<p>"But I can't&mdash;<i>I really can't</i>!"</p>

<p>"You made a promise, remember. And
upon that promise I made you a loan of five hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"I know!" cried the unhappy man, who had
sunk so deeply into the mire that extrication
seemed impossible. "I know! But it is a
promise that I can't fulfil. I won't be your tool
any longer. Gad! I won't. Don't you hear
me?"</p>

<p>"You must!" declared Weirmarsh, bending
forward and looking straight into his eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
"I will not!" shouted Sir Hugh, his eyes
flashing with quick anger. "Anything but
that."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"My efforts in that direction had tragic results
on the last occasion."</p>

<p>"Ah!" laughed Weirmarsh. "I see you
are superstitious&mdash;or something. I did not expect
that of you."</p>

<p>"I am not superstitious, Weirmarsh. I only
refuse to do what you want. If I gave it to you,
it would mean&mdash;no I won't&mdash;I tell you I
won't!"</p>

<p>"Bah! You are growing sentimental!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am growing wise. My eyes are at
last opened to the dastardly methods of you and
your infernal friends. Hear me, once and for
all; I refuse to assist you further; and, moreover,
I defy you!"</p>

<p>The doctor was silent for a moment, contemplating
the ruby on his finger. Then, rising
slowly from his chair, he said: "Ah! you do not
fully realise what your refusal may cost you."</p>

<p>"Cost what it may, Weirmarsh, I ask you
to leave my house at once," said the general,
scarlet with anger and beside himself with remorse.
"And I shall give orders that you are
not again to be admitted here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
"Very good!" laughed the other, with a sinister
grin. "You will very soon be seeking me
in my surgery."</p>

<p>"We shall see," replied Sir Hugh, with a
shrug of his shoulders, as the other strode out
of his room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h4>CONCERNING THE BELLAIRS AFFAIR</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> Walter Fetherston had feared had happened.
The two men had quarrelled! Throughout
the whole of that evening he watched the
doctor's movements.</p>

<p>In any other country but our dear old hood-winked
England, Fetherston, in the ordinary
course, would have been the recipient of high
honours from the Sovereign. But he was a
writer, and not a financier. He could not afford
to subscribe to the party funds, a course
suggested by the flat-footed old Lady G&mdash;&mdash;,
who was the tout of Government Whips.</p>

<p>Walter preferred to preserve his independence.
He had seen and known much during the
war, and, disgusted, he preferred to adopt the
Canadian Government's decree and remain
without "honours."</p>

<p>His pet phrase was: "The extent of a
Party's dishonours is known by the honours it
bestows. Scraps of ribbon, 'X.Y.Z.' or O.B.E.
behind one's name can neither make the gentleman
nor create the lady."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
His secret connection with Scotland Yard,
which was purely patriotic and conducted as a
student of underground crime, had taught him
many strange things, and he had learnt many
remarkable secrets. Some of them were, indeed,
his secrets before they became secrets of the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>Many of those secrets he kept to himself,
one being the remarkable truth that General Sir
Hugh Elcombe was implicated in a very strange
jumble of affairs&mdash;a matter that was indeed
incredible.</p>

<p>To the tall, well-groomed, military-looking
man with whom he stood at eleven o'clock on the
following morning&mdash;in a private room at New
Scotland Yard&mdash;he had never confided that discovery
of his. To have done so would have been
to betray a man who had a brilliant record as a
soldier, and who still held high position at the
War Office.</p>

<p>By such denunciation he knew he might earn
from "the eyes of the Government" very high
commendation, in addition to what he had already
earned, yet he had resolved, if possible,
to save the old officer, who was really more
sinned against than sinning.</p>

<p>"You seem to keep pretty close at the heels
of your friend, the doctor of Vauxhall Bridge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
Road!" laughed Trendall, the director of the
department, as they stood together in the big,
airy, official-looking room, the two long windows
of which looked out over Westminster Bridge.</p>

<p>"You've been in France, Montgomery says.
What was your friend doing there?"</p>

<p>"He's been there against his will&mdash;very
much against his will!"</p>

<p>"And you've found out something&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fetherston. "One or two
things."</p>

<p>"Something interesting, of course," remarked
the shrewd, active, dark-haired man of
fifty, under whose control was one of the most
important departments of Scotland Yard.
"But tell me, in what direction is this versatile
doctor of yours working just at the present?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know," was the novelist's reply, as
in a navy serge suit he leaned near the window
which overlooked the Thames. "I believe some
deep scheme is afoot, but at present I cannot
see very far. For that reason I am remaining
watchful."</p>

<p>"He does not suspect you, of course? If
he does, I'd give you Harris, or Charlesworth,
or another of the men&mdash;in fact, whoever you like&mdash;to
assist you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may require someone before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
long. If so, I will write or wire to the usual private
box at the General Post Office, and shall
then be glad if you will send a man to meet me."</p>

<p>"Certainly. It was you, Fetherston, who
first discovered the existence of this interesting
doctor, who had already lived in Vauxhall
Bridge Road for eighteen months without arousing
suspicion. You have, indeed, a fine nose
for mysteries."</p>

<p>At that moment the telephone, standing
upon the big writing-table, rang loudly, and the
man of secrets crossed to it and listened.</p>

<p>"It's Heywood&mdash;at Victoria Station. He's
asking for you," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Walter went to the instrument, and through
it heard the words: "The boat train has just
gone, sir. Mrs. Caldwell waited for the young
lady until the train went off, but she did not
arrive. She seemed annoyed and disappointed.
Dr. Weirmarsh has been on the platform, evidently
watching also."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Heywood," replied Fetherston
sharply; "that was all I wanted to know. Good
day."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver, and, walking back
to his friend against the window, explained: "A
simple little inquiry I was making regarding a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
departure by the boat train for Paris&mdash;that was
all."</p>

<p>But he reflected that if Weirmarsh had been
watching it must have been to warn the French
police over at Calais of the coming of Enid. No
action was too dastardly for that unscrupulous
scoundrel.</p>

<p>Yet, for the present at least, the girl remained
safe. The chief peril was that in which
Sir Hugh was placed, now that he had openly
defied the doctor.</p>

<p>On the previous evening he had been in the
drawing-room at Hill Street when Sir Hugh
had returned from interviewing the caller. By
his countenance and manner he at once realised
that the breach had been widened.</p>

<p>The one thought by which he was obsessed
was how he should save Sir Hugh from disgrace.
His connection with the Criminal Investigation
Department placed at his disposal a marvellous
network of sources of information, amazing as
they were unsuspected. He was secretly glad
that at last the old fellow had resolved to face
bankruptcy rather than go farther in that
strange career of crime, yet, at the same time,
there was serious danger&mdash;for Weirmarsh was a
man so unscrupulous and so vindictive that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
penalty of his defiance must assuredly be a severe
one.</p>

<p>The very presence of the doctor on the platform
of the South Eastern station at Victoria
that morning showed that he did not intend to
allow the grass to grow beneath his feet.</p>

<p>The novelist was still standing near the long
window, looking aimlessly down upon the Embankment,
with its hurrying foot-passengers and
whirling taxis.</p>

<p>"You seem unusually thoughtful, Fetherston,"
remarked Trendall with some curiosity,
as he seated himself at the table and resumed
the opening of his letters which his friend's visit
had interrupted. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, I'm very much puzzled."</p>

<p>"About what? You're generally very successful
in obtaining solutions where other men
have failed."</p>

<p>"To the problem which is greatly exercising
my mind just now I can obtain no solution," he
said in a low, intense voice.</p>

<p>"What is it? Can I help you?"</p>

<p>"Well," he exclaimed, with some hesitation,
"I am still trying to discover why Harry Bellairs
died and who killed him."</p>

<p>"That mystery has long ago been placed
by us among those which admit of no solution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
my dear fellow," declared his friend. "We did
our best to throw some light upon it, but all to
no purpose. I set the whole of our machinery
at work at the time&mdash;days before you suspected
anything wrong&mdash;but not a trace of the truth
could we find."</p>

<p>"But what could have been the motive, do
you imagine? From all accounts he was a most
popular young officer, without a single enemy
in the world."</p>

<p>"Jealousy," was the dark man's slow reply.
"My own idea is that a woman killed him."</p>

<p>"Why?" cried Walter quickly. "What
causes you to make such a suggestion?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;listen, and when I've finished you
can draw your own conclusions."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h4>THE SILENCE OF THE MAN BARKER</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Harry Bellairs</span> was an old friend of mine,"
Trendall went on, leaning back in his padded
writing-chair and turning towards where the
novelist was standing. "His curious end was
a problem which, of course, attracted you as a
writer of fiction. The world believed his death
to be due to natural causes, in view of the failure
of Professors Dale and Boyd, the Home Office
analysts, to find a trace of poison or of foul
play."</p>

<p>"You believe, then, that he was poisoned?"
asked Fetherston quickly.</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders, saying:
"How can that point be cleared up? There
was no evidence of it."</p>

<p>"It is curious that, though we are both so
intensely interested in the problem, we have
never before discussed it," remarked Walter.
"I am so anxious to hear your views upon one
or two points. What, for instance, do you think
of Barker, the dead man's valet?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
Herbert Trendall hesitated, and for a moment
twisted his moustache. He was a marvellously
alert man, an unusually good linguist, and
a cosmopolitan to his finger-tips. He had been
a detective-sergeant in the T Division of Metropolitan
Police for years before his appointment
as director of that section. He knew more of
the criminal undercurrents on the Continent
than any living Englishman, and it was he who
furnished accurate information to the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; in
Paris concerning the great Humbert swindle.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if I recollect aright, the
inquiries regarding him were not altogether
satisfactory. Previous to his engagement by
Harry he had, it seems, been valet to a man
named Mitchell, a horse-trainer of rather shady
repute."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know, but I can easily find
out&mdash;I gave orders that he was not to be lost
sight of." And, scribbling a hasty memorandum,
he pressed the electric button upon the arm
of his chair.</p>

<p>His secretary, a tall, thin, deep-eyed man,
entered, and to him he gave the note.</p>

<p>"Well, let us proceed while they are looking
up the information," the chief went on.
"Harry Bellairs, as you know, was on the staff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
of Sir Hugh Elcombe, that dear, harmless old
friend of yours who inspects troops and seems to
do odd jobs for Whitehall. I knew Harry before
he went to Sandhurst; his people, who lived up
near Durham, were very civil to me once or
twice and gave me some excellent pheasant-shooting.
It seems that on that day in September
he came up to town from Salisbury&mdash;but you
know all the facts, of course?"</p>

<p>"I know all the facts as far as they were
related in the papers," Walter said. He did not
reveal the results of the close independent inquiries
he had already made&mdash;results which had
utterly astounded, and at the same time mystified,
him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Trendall, "what the Press
published was mostly fiction. Even the evidence
given before the coroner was utterly unreliable.
It was mainly given in order to mislead the jury
and prevent public suspicion that there had been
a sensational tragedy&mdash;I arranged it so."</p>

<p>"And there had been a tragedy, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"Of course," declared the other, leaning both
elbows upon the table before him and looking
straight into the novelist's pale face. "Harry
came up from Salisbury, the bearer of some
papers from Sir Hugh. He duly arrived at
Waterloo, discharged his duty, and went to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
rooms in Half Moon Street. Now, according
to Barker's story, his master arrived home early
in the afternoon, and sent him out on a message
to Richmond. He returned a little after five,
when he found his master absent."</p>

<p>"That was the account he gave at the inquest,"
remarked Fetherston.</p>

<p>"Yes; but it was not the truth. On testing
the man's story I discovered that at three-eighteen
he was in the Leicester Lounge, in
Leicester Square, with an ill-dressed old man,
who was described as being short and wearing a
rusty, old silk hat. They sat at a table near the
window drinking ginger-ale, so that the barmaid
could not overhear, and held a long and confidential
chat."</p>

<p>"He may afterwards have gone down to
Richmond," his friend suggested.</p>

<p>"No; he remained there until past four, and
then went round to the Caf&eacute; Royal, where he
met another man, a foreigner, of about his own
age, believed to have been a Swiss, with whom
he took a cup of coffee. The man was a stranger
at the caf&eacute;, probably a stranger in London.
Barker was in the habit of doing a little betting,
and I believe the men he met were some of his
betting friends."</p>

<p>"Then you disbelieve the Richmond story?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
"Entirely. What seems more than probable
is that Harry gave his man the afternoon off because
he wished to entertain somebody clandestinely
at his rooms&mdash;a woman, perhaps. Yet,
as far as I've been able to discover, no one in
Half Moon Street saw any stranger of either
sex go to his chambers that afternoon."</p>

<p>"You said that you believed the motive of
the crime&mdash;if crime it really was&mdash;was jealousy,"
remarked Fetherston, thoughtfully rubbing his
shaven chin.</p>

<p>"And I certainly do. Harry was essentially
a lady's man. He was tall, and an extremely
handsome fellow, a thorough-going sportsman,
an excellent polo player, a perfect dancer, and a
splendid rider to hounds. Little wonder was it
that he was about to make a very fine match, for
only a month before his death he confided to me
in secret the fact&mdash;a fact known to me alone&mdash;that
he was engaged to pretty little Lady
Blanche Herbert, eldest daughter of the Earl
of Warsborough."</p>

<p>"Engaged to Lady Blanche!" echoed the
novelist in surprise, for the girl in question was
the prettiest of that year's d&eacute;butantes as well as
a great heiress in her own right.</p>

<p>"Yes. Harry was a lucky dog, poor fellow.
The engagement, known only to the Warsbor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>oughs
and myself, was to have been kept secret
for a year. Now, it is my firm opinion, Fetherston,
that some other woman, one of Harry's
many female friends, had got wind of it, and
very cleverly had her revenge."</p>

<p>"Upon what grounds do you suspect that?"
asked the other eagerly&mdash;for surely the problem
was becoming more inscrutable than any of
those in the remarkable romances which he
penned.</p>

<p>"Well, my conclusions are drawn from several
very startling facts&mdash;facts which, of course,
have never leaked out to the public. But before
I reveal them to you I'd like to hear what opinion
you've formed yourself."</p>

<p>"I'm convinced that Harry Bellairs met with
foul play, and I'm equally certain that the man
Barker lied in his depositions before the coroner.
He knows the whole story, and has been paid
to keep a still tongue."</p>

<p>"There I entirely agree with you," Trendall
declared quickly; while at that moment the secretary
returned with a slip of paper attached
to the query which his chief had written.
"Ah!" he exclaimed, glancing at the paper, "I
see that the fellow Barker, who was a chauffeur
before he entered Harry's service, has set up a
motor-car business in Southampton."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
"You believe him to have been an accessory,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a dupe in the hands of a clever
woman."</p>

<p>"Of what woman?" asked Walter, holding
his breath.</p>

<p>"As you know, Harry was secretary to your
friend Elcombe. Well, I happen to know that
his pretty stepdaughter, Enid Orlebar, was over
head and ears in love with him. My daughter
Ethel and she are friends, and she confided this
fact to Ethel only a month before the tragedy."</p>

<p>"Then you actually suggest that a&mdash;a certain
woman murdered him?" gasped Fetherston.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there is no actual proof&mdash;only
strong suspicion!"</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston held his breath. Did the
suspicions of this man, from whom no secret
was safe, run in the same direction as his own?</p>

<p>"There was in the evidence given before
the coroner a suggestion that the captain had
dined somewhere in secret," he said.</p>

<p>"I know. But we have since cleared up that
point. He was not given poison while he sat at
dinner, for we know that he dined at the Bachelors'
with a man named Friend. They had a
hurried meal, because Friend had to catch a
train to the west of England."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
"And afterwards?"</p>

<p>"He left the club in a taxi at eight. But
what his movements exactly were we cannot ascertain.
He returned to his chambers at a quarter
past nine in order to change his clothes and
go back to Salisbury, but he was almost immediately
taken ill. Barker declares that his master
sent him out on an errand instantly on his return,
and that when he came in he found him dying."</p>

<p>"Did he not explain what the errand was?"</p>

<p>"No; he refused to say."</p>

<p>In that refusal Fetherston saw that the valet,
whatever might be his fault, was loyal to his
dead master and to Enid Orlebar. He had not
told how Bellairs had sent to Hill Street that
scribbled note, and how the distressed girl had
torn along to Half Moon Street to arrive too
late to speak for the last time with the man she
loved. Was Barker an enemy, or was he a
friend?</p>

<p>"That refusal arouses distinct suspicion,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Barker has very cleverly concealed some
important fact," replied the keen-faced man who
controlled that section of Scotland Yard.
"Bellairs, feeling deadly ill, and knowing that
he had fallen a victim to some enemy, sent
Barker out for somebody in whom to confide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
The man claimed that the errand that his master
sent him upon was one of confidence."</p>

<p>"And to whom do you think he was sent?"</p>

<p>"To a woman," was Trendall's slow and
serious reply. "To the woman who murdered
him!"</p>

<p>"But if she had poisoned him, surely he
would not send for her?" exclaimed Fetherston.</p>

<p>"At the moment he was not aware of the
woman's jealousy, or of the subtle means used
to cause his untimely end. He was unsuspicious
of that cruel, deadly hatred lying so deep in
the woman's breast. Lady Blanche, on hearing
of the death of her lover, was terribly
grieved, and is still abroad. She, of course, made
all sorts of wild allegations, but in none of them
did we find any basis of fact. Yet, curiously
enough, her views were exactly the same as my
own&mdash;that one of poor Harry's lady friends had
been responsible for his fatal seizure."</p>

<p>"Then, after all the inquiries you instituted,
you were really unable to point to the
actual assassin?" asked Fetherston rather more
calmly.</p>

<p>"Not exactly unable&mdash;unwilling, rather."</p>

<p>"How do you mean unwilling? You were
Bellairs' friend!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was. He was one of the best and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
most noble fellows who ever wore the King's
uniform, and he died by the treacherous hand
of a jealous woman&mdash;a clever woman who had
paid Barker to maintain silence."</p>

<p>"But, if the dying man wished to make a
statement, he surely would not have sent for the
very person by whose hand he had fallen,"
Fetherston protested. "Surely that is not a
logical conclusion!"</p>

<p>"Bellairs was not certain that his sudden
seizure was not due to something he had eaten
at the club&mdash;remember he was not certain that
her hand had administered the fatal drug," replied
Trendall. A hard, serious expression
rested upon his face. "He had, no doubt, seen
her between the moment when he left the Bachelors'
and his arrival, a little over an hour afterwards,
at Half Moon Street&mdash;where, or how,
we know not. Perhaps he drove to her house,
and there, at her invitation, drank something.
Yet, however it happened, the result was the
same; she killed him, even though she was the
first friend to whom he sent in his distress&mdash;killed
him because she had somehow learnt of
his secret engagement to Lady Blanche Herbert."</p>

<p>"Yours is certainly a remarkable theory,"
admitted Walter Fetherston. "May I ask the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
name of the woman to whom you refer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she was the woman who loved him so
passionately," replied Trendall&mdash;"Enid Orlebar."</p>

<p>"Then you really suspect <i>her</i>?" asked Fetherston
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Only as far as certain facts are concerned;
and that since Harry's death she has been unceasingly
interested in the career of the man
Barker."</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain of this?" gasped
Fetherston.</p>

<p>"Quite; it is proved beyond the shadow of
a doubt."</p>

<p>"Then Enid Orlebar killed him?"</p>

<p>"That if she actually did not kill him with
her own hand, she at least knew well who did,"
was the other's cold, hard reply. "She killed
him for two reasons; first, because by poor
Harry's death she prevented the exposure of
some great secret!"</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston made no reply.</p>

<p>Those inquiries, instituted by Scotland
Yard, had resulted in exactly the same theory
as his own independent efforts&mdash;that Harry Bellairs
had been secretly done to death by the
woman, who, upon her own admission to him,
had been summoned to the young officer's side.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h4>WHAT THE DEAD MAN LEFT</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was news to Fetherston that Bellairs had
dined at his club on that fateful night.</p>

<p>He had believed that Enid had dined with
him. He had proved beyond all doubt that she
had been to his rooms that afternoon during
Barker's absence. That feather from the boa,
and the perfume, were sufficient evidence of her
visit.</p>

<p>Yet why had Barker remained in the neighbourhood
of Piccadilly Circus if sent by his master
with a message to Richmond? He could not
doubt a single word that Trendall had told him,
for the latter's information was beyond question.
Well he knew with what care and cunning such
an inquiry would have been made, and how every
point would have been proved before being reported
to that ever active man who was head
of that Department of the Home Office that
never sleeps.</p>

<p>"What secret do you suggest might have
been divulged?" he asked at last after a long
pause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
The big room&mdash;the Room of Secrets&mdash;was
silent, for the double windows prevented the
noise of the traffic and the "honk" of the taxi
horns from penetrating there. Only the low
ticking of the clock broke the quiet.</p>

<p>"I scarcely have any suggestion to offer in
that direction," was Trendall's slow reply.
"That feature of the affair still remains a
mystery."</p>

<p>"But cannot this man Barker be induced
to make some statement?" he queried.</p>

<p>"He will scarcely betray the woman to whom
he owes his present prosperity, for he is prosperous
and has a snug little balance at his bank.
Besides, even though we took the matter in hand,
what could we do? There is no evidence against
him or against the woman. The farcical proceedings
in the coroner's court had tied their
hands."</p>

<p>"An open verdict was returned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at our suggestion. But Professors
Dale and Boyd failed to find any traces of
poison or of foul play."</p>

<p>"And yet there <i>was</i> foul play&mdash;that is absolutely
certain!" declared the novelist.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, yes. Poor Bellairs was a
brilliant and promising officer, a man destined
to make a distinct mark in the world. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
a pity, perhaps, that he was such a lady-killer."</p>

<p>"A pity that he fell victim to what was evidently
a clever plot, and yet&mdash;yet&mdash;I cannot
bring myself to believe that your surmise can
be actually correct. He surely would never have
sent for the very person who was his enemy and
who had plotted to kill him&mdash;it doesn't seem
feasible, does it?"</p>

<p>"Quite as feasible as any of the strange and
crooked circumstances which one finds every day
in life's undercurrents," was the quiet rejoinder.
"Remember, he was very fond of her&mdash;fascinated
by her remarkable beauty."</p>

<p>"But he was engaged to Lady Blanche?"</p>

<p>"He intended to marry her, probably for
wealth and position. The woman a man of
Harry's stamp marries is seldom, if ever, the
woman he loves," added the chief with a somewhat
cynical smile, for he was essentially a man
of the world.</p>

<p>"But what secret could Enid Orlebar desire
to hide?" exclaimed Fetherston wonderingly.
"If he loved her, he certainly would never have
threatened exposure."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I've told you briefly my
own theory&mdash;a theory formed upon all the evidence
I could collect," replied the tall, dark-eyed
man, as he thrust his hands deeply into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>
trousers pockets and looked straight into the
eyes of his friend.</p>

<p>"If you are so certain that Enid Orlebar is
implicated in the affair, if not the actual assassin,
why don't you interrogate her?" asked Walter
boldly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well, to tell the truth, our inquiries
are not yet complete. When they are, we may
be in a better position&mdash;we probably shall be&mdash;to
put to her certain pointed questions. But,"
he added quickly, "perhaps I ought not to say
this, for I know she is a friend of yours."</p>

<p>"What you tell me is in confidence, as always,
Trendall," he replied quickly. "I knew
long ago that Enid was deeply attached to Bellairs.
But much that you have just told me is
entirely fresh to me. I must find Barker and
question him."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd do that. Wait until we
have completed our inquiries," urged the other.
"If Bellairs was killed in so secret and scientific
a manner that no trace was left, he was killed
with a cunning and craftiness which betrays a
jealous woman rather than a man. Besides,
there are other facts we have gathered which
go further to prove that Enid Orlebar is the
actual culprit."</p>

<p>"What are they? Tell me, Trendall."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>
"No, my dear chap; you are the lady's friend&mdash;it
is really unfair to ask me," he protested.
"Where the usual mysteries are concerned, I'm
always open and above-board with you. But in
private investigations like this you must allow
me to retain certain knowledge to myself."</p>

<p>"But I beg of you to tell me everything,"
demanded the other. "I have taken an intense
interest in the matter, as you have, even though
my motive has been of an entirely different
character."</p>

<p>"You have no suspicion that Bellairs was in
possession of any great secret&mdash;a secret which it
was to Miss Orlebar's advantage should be
kept?"</p>

<p>"No," was the novelist's prompt response.
"But I can't see the drift of your question,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the keen, alert man, who,
again seated in his writing-chair, bent slightly
towards his visitor, "well, as you've asked me
to reveal all I know, Fetherston, I will do so,
even though I feel some reluctance, in face of the
fact that Miss Orlebar is your friend."</p>

<p>"That makes no difference," declared the
other firmly. "I am anxious to clear up the
mystery of Bellairs' death."</p>

<p>"Then I think that you need seek no farther<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
for the correct solution," replied Trendall
quietly, looking into the other's pale countenance.
"Your lady friend killed him&mdash;<i>in order
to preserve her own secret</i>."</p>

<p>"But what was her secret?"</p>

<p>"We have that yet to establish. It must
have been a serious one for her to close his lips
in such a manner."</p>

<p>"But they were good friends," declared
Fetherston. "He surely had not threatened to
expose her?"</p>

<p>"I do not think he had. My own belief is
that she became madly jealous of Lady Blanche,
and at the same time, fearing the exposure of
her secret to the woman to whom her lover had
become engaged, she took the subtle means of
silencing him. Besides&mdash;&mdash;" And he paused
without concluding his sentence.</p>

<p>"Besides what?"</p>

<p>"From the first you suspected Sir Hugh's
stepdaughter, eh?"</p>

<p>Fetherston hesitated. Then afterwards he
nodded slowly in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Trendall, "I knew all along
that you were suspicious. You made a certain
remarkable discovery, eh, Fetherston?"</p>

<p>The novelist started. At what did his friend
hint? Was it possible that the inquiries had led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>
to a suspicion of Sir Hugh's criminal conduct?
The very thought appalled him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, in the course of the inquiries I
made I found that the lady in question was
greatly attached to the dead man," replied Fetherston
rather lamely.</p>

<p>Trendall smiled. "It was to Enid Orlebar
that Harry sent when he felt his fatal seizure.
Instead of sending for a doctor, he sent Barker
to her, and she at once flew to his side, but, alas!
too late to remedy the harm she had already
caused. When she arrived he was dead!"</p>

<p>Fetherston was silent. He saw that the inquiries
made by the Criminal Investigation Department
had led to exactly the same conclusion
that he himself had formed.</p>

<p>"This is a most distressing thought&mdash;that
Enid Orlebar is a murderess!" he declared after
a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;I admit. Yet we cannot close our
eyes to such outstanding facts, my dear chap.
Depend upon it that there is something behind
the poor fellow's death of which we have no
knowledge. In his death your friend Miss Orlebar
sought safety. The letter he wrote to her
a week before his assassination is sufficient evidence
of that."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
"A letter!" gasped Fetherston. "Is there
one in existence?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is in our possession; it reveals the
existence of the secret."</p>

<p>"But what was its nature?" cried Fetherston
in dismay. "What terrible secret could
there possibly be that could only be preserved
by Bellairs' silence?"</p>

<p>"That's just the puzzle we have to solve&mdash;just
the very point which has mystified us all
along."</p>

<p>And then he turned to his correspondence
again, opening his letters one after the other&mdash;letters
which, addressed to a box at the General
Post Office in the City, contained secret information
from various unsuspected quarters at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in order to change the topic of
conversation, which he knew was painful to Walter
Fetherston, he mentioned the excellence of
the opera at Covent Garden on the previous
night. And afterwards he referred to an article
in that day's paper which dealt with the idea of
obtaining exclusive political intelligence through
spirit-bureaux. Then, speaking of the labour
unrest, Trendall pronounced his opinion as follows:</p>

<p>"The whole situation would be ludicrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
were it not urged so persistently as to be a
menace not so much in this country, where we
know too well the temperaments of its sponsors,
but abroad, where public opinion, imperfectly
instructed, may imagine it represents a serious
national feeling. The continuance of it is an
intolerable negation of civilisation; it is supported
by no public men of credit; it has been
disproved again and again. Ridicule may be left
to give the menace the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>! And
this," he laughed, "in face of what you and I
know, eh? Ah! how long will the British public
be lulled to sleep by anonymous scribblers?"</p>

<p>"One day they'll have a rude awakening,"
declared Fetherston, still thinking, however, of
that letter of the dead man to Enid. "I wonder,"
he added, "I wonder who inspires these
denials? We know, of course, that each time
anything against enemy interests appears in a
certain section of the Press there arises a ready
army of letter-writers who rush into print and
append their names to assurances that the enemy
is nowadays our best friend. Those 'patriotic
Englishmen' are, many of them, in high positions.</p>

<p>"When responsible papers wilfully mislead
the public, what can be expected?" Walter went
on. "But," he added after a pause, "we did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the
tragic death of Bellairs. What about that letter
of his?"</p>

<p>Trendall was thoughtful for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"My conclusion&mdash;the only one that can be
formed," he answered at last, disregarding his
friend's question&mdash;"is that Enid Orlebar is the
guilty person; and before long I hope to be in
possession of that secret which she strove by her
crime to suppress&mdash;a secret which I feel convinced
we shall discover to be one of an amazing
character."</p>

<p>Walter stood motionless as a statue.</p>

<p>Surely Bellairs had not died by Enid's hand!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h4>AT THE CAF&Eacute; DE PARIS</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the early days of January&mdash;damp and
foggy in England.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston sat idling on the <i>terrasse</i>
of the Caf&eacute; de Paris in Monte Carlo sipping a
"mazagran," basking in the afternoon sunshine,
and listening to the music of the Rumanian
Orchestra.</p>

<p>Around him everywhere was the gay cosmopolitan
world of the tables&mdash;that giddy little
after-the-war financier and profiteer world which
amuses itself on the C&ocirc;te d'Azur, and in which
he was such a well-known figure.</p>

<p>So many successive seasons had he passed
there before 1914 that across at the rooms the
attendants and croupiers knew him as an habitu&eacute;,
and he was always granted the <i>carte blanche</i>&mdash;the
white card of the professional gambler.
With nearly half the people he met he had a
nodding acquaintance, for friendships are
easily formed over the <i>tapis vert</i>&mdash;and as easily
dropped.</p>

<p>Preferring the fresher air of Nice, he made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>
his headquarters at the H&ocirc;tel Royal on the
world-famed promenade, and came over to
"Monte" daily by the <i>rapide</i>.</p>

<p>Much had occurred since that autumn morning
when he had stood with Herbert Trendall
in the big room at New Scotland Yard, much
that had puzzled him, much that had held him
in fear lest the ghastly truth concerning Sir
Hugh should be revealed.</p>

<p>His own activity had been, perhaps, unparalleled.
The strain of such constant travel
and continual excitement would have broken
most men; but he possessed an iron constitution,
and though he spent weeks on end in trains and
steamboats, it never affected him in the least.
He could snatch sleep at any time, and he could
write anywhere.</p>

<p>Whether or not Enid had guessed the reason
of his urgent appeal to her not to pass
through France, she had nevertheless managed
to excuse herself; but a week after Mrs. Caldwell's
departure she had travelled alone by the
Harwich-Antwerp route, evidently much to the
annoyance of the alert doctor of Pimlico.</p>

<p>Walter had impressed upon her the desirability
of not entering France&mdash;without, however,
giving any plain reason. He left her to
guess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
Through secret sources in Paris he had learnt
how poor Paul Le Pontois was still awaiting
trial. In order not to excite public opinion, the
matter was being kept secret by the French
authorities, and it had been decided that the inquiry
should be held with closed doors.</p>

<p>A week after his arrest the French police
received additional evidence against him in the
form of a cryptic telegram addressed to the Ch&acirc;teau,
an infamous and easily deciphered message
which, no doubt, had been sent with the
distinct purpose of strengthening the amazing
charge against him. He protested entire ignorance
of the sender and of the meaning of the
message, but his accusers would not accept any
disclaimer. So cleverly, indeed, had the message
been worded that at the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; it was believed
to refer to the price he had received for
certain bundles of spurious notes.</p>

<p>Without a doubt the scandalous telegram
had been sent at Weirmarsh's instigation by one
of his friends in order to influence the authorities
in Paris.</p>

<p>So far as the doctor was concerned he was
ever active in receiving reports from his cosmopolitan
friends abroad. But since his quarrel
with Sir Hugh he had ceased to visit Hill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
Street, and had, apparently, dropped the old
general's acquaintance.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh was congratulating himself at the
easy solution of the difficulty, but Walter, seated
at that little marble-topped table in the winter
sunshine, knowing Weirmarsh's character,
remained in daily apprehension.</p>

<p>The exciting life he led in assisting to watch
those whom Scotland Yard suspected was as
nothing compared with the constant fear of the
unmasking of Sir Hugh Elcombe. Doctor
Weirmarsh was an enemy, and a formidable one.</p>

<p>The mystery concerning the death of Bellairs
had increased rather than diminished. Each
step he had taken in the inquiry only plunged
him deeper and deeper into an inscrutable problem.
He had devoted weeks to endeavouring to
solve the mystery, but it remained, alas! inscrutable.</p>

<p>Enid and Mrs. Caldwell had altered their
plans, and had gone to Sicily instead of to
Egypt, first visiting Palermo and Syracuse, and
were at the moment staying at the popular "San
Domenico" at Taormina, amid that gem of
Mediterranean scenery. Sir Hugh and his wife,
much upset by Blanche's sudden arrival in London,
had not gone abroad that winter, but had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
remained at Hill Street to comfort Paul's wife
and child.</p>

<p>As for Walter, he had of late been wandering
far afield, in Petrograd, Geneva, Rome,
Florence, M&aacute;laga, and for the past week had
been at Monte Carlo. He was not there wholly
for pleasure, for, if the truth be told, there were
seated at the farther end of the <i>terrasse</i> a smartly
dressed man and a woman in whom he had
for the past month been taking a very keen interest.</p>

<p>This pair, of Swiss nationality, he had
watched in half a dozen Continental cities, gradually
establishing his suspicions as to their real
occupation.</p>

<p>They had come to Monte Carlo for neither
health nor pleasure, but in order to meet a grey-haired
man in spectacles, whom they received
twice in private at the M&eacute;tropole, where they
were staying.</p>

<p>The Englishman had first seen them sitting
together one evening at one of the marble-topped
tables at the Caf&eacute; Royal in Regent
Street, while he had been idly playing a game of
dominoes at the next table with an American
friend. The face of the man was to him somehow
familiar. He felt that he had seen it somewhere,
but whether in a photograph in his big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
album down at Idsworth or in the flesh he could
not decide.</p>

<p>Yet from that moment he had hardly lost
sight of them. With that astuteness which was
Fetherston's chief characteristic, he had watched
vigilantly and patiently, establishing the fact
that the pair were in England for some sinister
purpose. His powers were little short of marvellous.
He really seemed, as Trendall once
put it, to scent the presence of criminals as pigs
scent truffles.</p>

<p>They suddenly left the Midland Hotel at St.
Pancras, where they were staying, and crossed
the Channel. But the same boat carried Walter
Fetherston, who took infinite care not to obtrude
himself upon their attention.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo, being in the principality of
Monaco, and being peopled by the most cosmopolitan
crowd in the whole world, is in winter
the recognised meeting-place of <i>chevaliers d'industrie</i>
and those who finance and control great
crimes.</p>

<p>In the big atrium of those stifling rooms
many an assassin has met his hirer, and in many
of those fine hotels have bribes been handed over
to those who will do "dirty work." It is the
European exchange of criminality, for both
sexes know it to be a safe place where they may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
"accidentally" meet the person controlling
them.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that in every code used by
the criminal plotters of every country in Europe
there is a cryptic word which signifies a meeting
at Monte Carlo. For that reason was Walter
Fetherston much given to idling on the sunny
<i>terrasse</i> of the caf&eacute; at a point where he could
see every person who ascended or descended
that flight of red-carpeted stairs which gives entrance
to the rooms.</p>

<p>The pair whom he was engaged in watching
had been playing at roulette with five-franc
pieces, and the woman was now counting her
gains and laughing gaily with her husband as
she slowly sipped her tea flavoured with orange-flower
water. They were in ignorance of the
presence of that lynx-eyed man in grey flannels
and straw hat who smoked his cigarette leisurely
and appeared to be so intensely bored.</p>

<p>No second glance at Fetherston was needed
to ascertain that he was a most thorough-going
cosmopolitan. He usually wore his pale-grey
felt hat at a slight angle, and had the air of the
easy-going adventurer, debonair and unscrupulous.
But in his case his appearance was not a
true index to his character, for in reality he was
a steady, hard-headed, intelligent man, the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
soul of honour, and, above all, a man of intense
patriotism&mdash;an Englishman to the backbone.
Still, he cultivated his easy-going cosmopolitanism
to pose as a careless adventurer.</p>

<p>Presently the pair rose, and, crossing the
palm-lined place, entered the casino; while Walter,
finishing his "mazagran," lit a fresh cigarette,
and took a turn along the front of the casino
in order to watch the pigeon-shooting.</p>

<p>The winter sun was sinking into the tideless
sea in all its gold-and-orange glory as he stood
leaning over the stone balustrade watching the
splendid marksmanship of one of the crack shots
of Europe. He waited until the contest had
ended, then he descended and took the <i>rapide</i>
back to Nice for dinner.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he returned to Monte Carlo,
and again ascended the station lift, as was his
habit, for a stroll through the rooms and a chat
and drink with one or other of his many friends.
He looked everywhere for the Swiss pair in
whom he was so interested, but in vain. Probably
they had gone over to Nice to spend the
evening, he thought. But as the night wore on
and they did not return by the midnight train&mdash;the
arrival of which he watched&mdash;he strolled
back to the M&eacute;tropole and inquired for them at
the bureau of the hotel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
"M'sieur and Madame Granier left by the
Mediterranean express for Paris at seven-fifteen
this evening," replied the clerk, who knew
Walter very well.</p>

<p>"What address did they leave?" he inquired,
annoyed at the neat manner in which
they had escaped his vigilance.</p>

<p>"They left no address, m'sieur. They received
a telegram just after six o'clock recalling
them to Paris immediately. Fortunately, there
was one two-berth compartment vacant on the
train."</p>

<p>Walter turned away full of chagrin. He
had been foolish to lose sight of them. His only
course was to return to Nice, pack his traps,
and follow to Paris in the ordinary <i>rapide</i> at
eight o'clock next morning. And this was the
course he pursued.</p>

<p>But Paris is a big place, and though he
searched for two whole weeks, going hither and
thither to all places where the foreign visitors
mostly congregate, he saw nothing of the interesting
pair. Therefore, full of disappointment,
he crossed one afternoon to Folkestone,
and that night again found himself in his dingy
chambers in Holles Street.</p>

<p>Next day he called upon Sir Hugh, and
found him in much better spirits. Lady El<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>combe
told him that Enid had written expressing
herself delighted with her season in Sicily,
and saying that both she and Mrs. Caldwell were
very pleased that they had adopted his suggestion
of going there instead of to overcrowded
Cairo.</p>

<p>As he sat with Sir Hugh and his wife in that
pretty drawing-room he knew so well the old
general suddenly said: "I suppose, Fetherston,
you are still taking as keen an interest in
the latest mysteries of crime&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Hugh. As you know, I've written
a good deal upon the subject."</p>

<p>"I've read a good many of your books and
articles, of course," exclaimed the old officer.
"Upon many points I entirely agree with you,"
he said. "There is a curious case in the papers
to-day. Have you seen it? A young girl found
mysteriously shot dead near Hitchin."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," was Walter's reply. He
was not at all interested. He was thinking of
something of far greater interest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h4>WHICH IS "PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL"</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> eleven o'clock next morning Fetherston
stood in Trendall's room at Scotland Yard reporting
to him the suspicious movements of
Monsieur and Madame Granier.</p>

<p>His friend leaned back in his padded chair
listening while the keen-faced man in pince-nez
related all the facts, and in doing so showed how
shrewd and astute he had been.</p>

<p>"Then they are just what we thought," remarked
the chief.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt. In Monte Carlo they
received further instructions from somebody.
They went to Paris, and there I lost them."</p>

<p>Trendall smiled, for he saw how annoyed his
friend was at their escape.</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly clung on to them," he
said. "When you first told me your suspicions
I confess I was inclined to disagree with you.
You merely met them casually in Regent Street.
What made you suspicious?"</p>

<p>"One very important incident&mdash;Weirmarsh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>
came in with another man, and, in passing, nodded
to Granier. That set me thinking."</p>

<p>"But you do not know of any actual dealings
with the doctor?"</p>

<p>"I know of none," replied Walter. "Still,
I'm very sick that, after all my pains, they
should have escaped to Paris so suddenly."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Trendall. "If they are
what we suspect we shall pick them up again
before long, no doubt. Now look here," he added.
"Read that! It's just come in. As you
know, any foreigner who takes a house in certain
districts nowadays is reported to us by the
local police."</p>

<p>Fetherston took the big sheet of blue official
paper which the police official handed to him,
and found that it was the copy of a confidential
report made by the Superintendent of Police at
Maldon, in Essex, and read as follows:</p>

<p>"I, William Warden, Superintendent of
Police for the Borough of Maldon, desire to report
to the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police
the following statement from Sergeant S.
Deacon, Essex Constabulary, stationed at
Southminster, which is as below:</p>

<p>"'On Friday, the thirteenth of September
last, a gentleman, evidently a foreigner, was
sent by Messrs. Hare and James, estate agents,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
of Malden, to view the house known as The
Yews, at Asheldham, in the vicinity of Southminster,
and agreed to take it for three years
in order to start a poultry farm. The tenant entered
into possession a week later, when one vanload
of furniture arrived from London. Two
days later three other vanloads arrived late in
the evening, and were unpacked in the stable-yard
at dawn. The tenant, whose name is Bailey&mdash;but
whose letters come addressed "Baily,"
and are mostly from Belgium&mdash;lived there alone
for a fortnight, and was afterwards joined by
a foreign man-servant named Pietro, who is
believed to be an Italian. Though more than
three months have elapsed, and I have kept observation
upon the house&mdash;a large one, standing
in its own grounds&mdash;I have seen no sign of
poultry farming, and therefore deem it a matter
for a report.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Samuel Deacon</span>, Sergeant, Essex
Constabulary.'"</p>

<p>"Curious!" remarked Walter, when he had
finished reading it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Trendall. "There may be
nothing in it."</p>

<p>"It should be inquired into!" declared Walter.
"I'll take Summers and go down there to
have a look round, if you like."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said the chief. "I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
'phone Summers to meet you at Liverpool
Street Station," he added, turning to the railway
guide. "There's a train at one forty-five.
Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Tell him to meet me at Liverpool
Street&mdash;and we'll see who this 'Mr. Baily' really
is."</p>

<p>When, shortly after half-past one, the novelist
walked on to the platform at Liverpool
Street he was approached by a narrow-faced,
middle-aged man in a blue serge suit who presented
the appearance of a ship's engineer on
leave.</p>

<p>As they sat together in a first-class compartment
Fetherston explained to his friend the report
made by the police officer at Southminster&mdash;the
next station to Burnham-on-Crouch&mdash;whereupon
Summers remarked: "The doctor
has been down this way once or twice of late. I
wonder if he goes to pay this Mr. Baily, or Bailey,
a visit?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," laughed Walter. "We shall
see."</p>

<p>The railway ended at Southminster, but on
alighting they had little difficulty in finding the
small police station, where the local sergeant of
police awaited them, having been warned by
telephone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
"Well, gentlemen," said the red-faced man,
spreading his big hands on his knees as they sat
together in a back room, "Mr. Bailey ain't at
home just now. He's away a lot. The house
is a big one&mdash;not too big for the four vanloads
of furniture wot came down from London."</p>

<p>"Has he made any friends in the district,
do you know?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. 'E often goes and 'as a
drink at the Bridgewick Arms at Burnham, close
by the coastguard station."</p>

<p>Walter exchanged a meaning glance with
his assistant.</p>

<p>"Does he receive any visitors?"</p>

<p>"Very few&mdash;he's away such a lot. A woman
comes down to see him sometimes&mdash;his sister,
they say she is."</p>

<p>"What kind of a woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a lady about thirty-five&mdash;beautifully
dressed always. She generally comes in a
dark-green motor-car, which she drives herself.
She was a lady driver during the war."</p>

<p>"Do you know her name?"</p>

<p>"Miss Bailey. She's a foreigner, of course."</p>

<p>"Any other visitors?" asked Fetherston, in
his quick, impetuous way, as he polished his
pince-nez.</p>

<p>"One day, very soon after Mr. Bailey took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
the house, I was on duty at Southminster Station
in the forenoon, and a gentleman and lady
arrived and asked how far it was to The Yews,
at Asheldham. I directed them the way to walk
over by Newmoor and across the brook. Then
I slipped 'ome, got into plain clothes, and went
along after them by the footpath."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" asked Summers.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to find out something
about this foreigner's visitors. I read at headquarters
at Maldon the new instructions about
reporting all foreigners who took houses, and I
wanted to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To show that you were on the alert, eh,
Deacon?" laughed the novelist good-humouredly,
and he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"That's so, sir," replied the big, red-faced
man. "Well, I took a short cut over to The
Yews, and got there ten minutes before they did.
I hid in the hedge on the north side of the house,
and saw that as soon as they walked up the drive
Mr. Bailey rushed out to welcome them. The
lady seemed very nervous, I thought. I know
she was an English lady, because she spoke to
me at the station."</p>

<p>"What were they like?" inquired Summers.
"Describe both of them."</p>

<p>"Well, the man, as far as I can recollect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
was about fifty or so, grey-faced, dark-eyed,
wearin' a heavy overcoat with astrachan collar
and cuffs. He had light grey su&egrave;de gloves, and
carried a gold-mounted malacca cane with a
curved handle. The woman was quite young&mdash;not
more'n twenty, I should think&mdash;and very
good-lookin'. She wore a neat tailor-made dress
of brown cloth, and a small black velvet hat with
a big gold buckle. She had a greyish fur around
her neck, with a muff to match, and carried a
small, dark green leather bag."</p>

<p>Walter stood staring at the speaker. The
description was exactly that of Weirmarsh and
Enid Orlebar. The doctor often wore an astrachan-trimmed
overcoat, while both dress and
hat were the same which Enid had worn three
months ago!</p>

<p>He made a few quick inquiries of the red-faced
sergeant, but the man's replies only served
to convince him that Enid had actually been a
visitor at the mysterious house.</p>

<p>"You did not discover their names?"</p>

<p>"The young lady addressed her companion
as 'Doctor.' That's all I know," was the officer's
reply. "For that reason I was rather inclined
to think that I was on the wrong scent.
The man was perhaps, after all, only a doctor
who had come down to see his patient."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
"Perhaps so," remarked Walter mechanically.
"You say Mr. Bailey is not at home to-day,
so we'll just run over and have a look
round. You'd better come with us, sergeant."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. But I 'ear as how Mr. Bailey
is comin' home this evenin'. I met Pietro in
the Railway Inn at Southminster the night before
last, and casually asked when his master
was comin' home, as I wanted to see 'im for a
subscription for our police concert, and 'e told
me that the signore&mdash;that's what 'e called him&mdash;was
comin' home to-night."</p>

<p>"Good! Then, after a look round the place,
we hope to have the pleasure of seeing this mysterious
foreigner who comes here to the Dengie
Marshes to make a living out of fowl-keeping."
And Walter smiled meaningly at his companion.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, after the sergeant had
changed into plain clothes, the trio set out along
the flat, muddy road for Asheldham.</p>

<p>But as they were walking together, after
passing Northend, a curious thing happened.</p>

<p>Summers started back suddenly and nudged
the novelist's arm without a word.</p>

<p>Fetherston, looking in the direction indicated,
halted, utterly staggered by what met his
gaze.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
It was inexplicable&mdash;incredible! He looked
again, scarcely believing his own eyes, for what
he saw made plain a ghastly truth.</p>

<p>He stood rigid, staring straight before him.</p>

<p>Was it possible that at last he was actually
within measurable distance of the solution of
the mystery?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h4>THE RESULT OF INVESTIGATION</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the expectant trio had come round the bend
in the road they saw in front of them, walking
alone, a young lady in a short tweed suit with
hat to match.</p>

<p>The gown was of a peculiar shade of grey,
and by her easy, swinging gait and the graceful
carriage of her head Walter Fetherston instantly
recognised that there before him, all unconscious
of his presence, was the girl he believed
to be still in Sicily&mdash;Enid Orlebar!</p>

<p>He looked again, to satisfy himself that he
was not mistaken. Then, drawing back, lest her
attention should be attracted by their footsteps,
he motioned to his companions to retreat around
the bend and thus out of her sight.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, addressing them, "there is
some deep mystery here. That lady must not
know we are here."</p>

<p>"You've recognised her, sir?" asked Summers,
who had on several previous occasions assisted
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
"Yes," was the novelist's hard reply. "She
is here with some mysterious object. You
mustn't approach The Yews till dark."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bailey will then be at home, sir," remarked
the sergeant. "I thought you wished to
explore the place before he arrived?"</p>

<p>Walter paused. He saw that Enid could
not be on her way to visit Bailey, if he were not
at home. So he suggested that Summers, whom
she did not know, should go forward and watch
her movements, while he and the sergeant should
proceed to the house of suspicion.</p>

<p>Arranging to meet later, the officer from
Scotland Yard lit his pipe and strolled quickly
forward around the bend to follow the girl in
grey, while the other two halted to allow them
to get on ahead.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen that lady down here
before, sergeant?" asked Walter presently.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. If I don't make a mistake, it is
the same lady who asked me the way to The
Yews soon after Mr. Bailey took the house&mdash;the
lady who came with the man whom she addressed
as 'Doctor'!"</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain of this?"</p>

<p>"Not quite certain. She was dressed differently,
in brown&mdash;with a different hat and a
veil."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
"They came only on that one occasion,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Only that once, sir."</p>

<p>"But why, I wonder, is she going to The
Yews? Pietro, you say, went up to London
this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, by the nine-five. And the house
is locked up&mdash;she's evidently unaware of that."</p>

<p>"No doubt. She'll go there, and, finding
nobody at home, turn away disappointed. She
must not see us."</p>

<p>"We'll take good care of that, sir," laughed
the local sergeant breezily, as he left his companion's
side and crossed the road so that he
could see the bend. "Why!" he exclaimed,
"she ain't goin' to Asheldham after all! She's
taken the footpath to the left that leads into
Steeple! Evidently she knows the road!"</p>

<p>"Then we are free to go straight along to
The Yews, eh? She's making a call in the vicinity.
I wonder where she's going?"</p>

<p>"Your friend will ascertain that," said the
sergeant. "Let's get along to The Yews and
'ave a peep round."</p>

<p>Therefore the pair, now that Enid was sufficiently
far ahead along a footpath which led
under a high, bare hedge, went forth again down
the high road until, after crossing the brook,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
they turned to the right into Asheldham village,
where, half-way between that place and New
Hall, they turned up a short by-road, a cul-de-sac,
at the end of which a big, old-fashioned, red-brick
house of the days of Queen Anne, half hidden
by a belt of high Scotch firs, came into view.</p>

<p>Shut off from the by-road by a high, time-mellowed
brick wall, it stood back lonely and
secluded in about a couple of acres of well wooded
ground. From a big, rusty iron gate the ill-kept,
gravelled drive took a broad sweep up
to the front of the house, a large, roomy one
with square, inartistic windows and plain front,
the ugliness of which the ivy strove to hide.</p>

<p>In the grey light of that wintry afternoon
the place looked inexpressibly dismal and neglected.
Years ago it had, no doubt, been the
residence of some well-to-do county family; but
in these twentieth-century post-war days, having
been empty for nearly ten years, it had gone
sadly to rack and ruin.</p>

<p>The lawns had become weedy, the carriage-drive
was, in places, green with moss, like the
sills of the windows and the high-pitched, tiled
roof itself. In the centre of the lawn, before the
house, stood four great ancient yews, while all
round were high box hedges, now, alas! neglected,
untrimmed and full of holes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
The curtains were of the commonest kind,
while the very steps leading to the front door
were grey with lichen and strewn with wisps of
straw. The whole aspect was one of neglect,
of decay, of mystery.</p>

<p>The two men, opening the creaking iron gate,
advanced boldly to the door, an excuse ready
in case Pietro opened it.</p>

<p>They knocked loudly, but there was no response.
Their summons echoed through the big
hall, causing Walter to remark:</p>

<p>"There can't be much furniture inside,
judging from the sound."</p>

<p>"Four motor vanloads came here," responded
the sergeant. "The first was in a plain van."</p>

<p>"You did not discover whence it came?"</p>

<p>"I asked the driver down at the inn at
Southminster, and he told me that they came
from the Trinity Furnishing Company, Peckham.
But, on making inquiries, I found that
he lied; there is no such company in Peckham."</p>

<p>"You saw the furniture unloaded?"</p>

<p>"I was about here when the first lot came.
When the other three vans arrived I was away
on my annual leave," was the sergeant's reply.</p>

<p>Again they knocked, but no one came to the
door. A terrier approached, but he proved
friendly, therefore they proceeded to make an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
inspection of the empty stabling and disused
outbuildings.</p>

<p>Three old hen-coops were the only signs of
poultry-farming they could discover, and these,
placed in a conspicuous position in the big,
paved yard, were without feathered occupants.</p>

<p>There were three doors by which the house
could be entered, and all of them Walter tried
and found locked. Therefore, noticing in the
rubbish-heap some stray pieces of paper, he at
once turned his attention to what he discovered
were fragments of a torn letter. It was written
in French, and, apparently, had reference to
certain securities held by the tenant of The
Yews.</p>

<p>But as only a small portion of the destroyed
communication could be found, its purport was
not very clear, and the name and address of the
writer could not be ascertained.</p>

<p>Yet it had already been proved without
doubt that the mysterious tenant of the dismal
old place&mdash;the man who posed as a poultry-farmer&mdash;had
had as visitors Dr. Weirmarsh and
Enid <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Olebar'">Orlebar</ins>!</p>

<p>For a full half-hour, while the red-faced sergeant
kept watch at the gate, Walter Fetherston
continued to investigate that rubbish-heap,
which showed signs of having been burning quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[<a href="./images/280.png">280</a>]</span>
recently, for most of the scraps of paper were
charred at their edges.</p>

<p>The sodden remains of many letters he withdrew
and tried to read, but the scraps gave no
tangible result, and he was just about to relinquish
his search when his eye caught a scrap
of bright blue notepaper of a familiar hue. It
was half burned, and blurred by the rain, but at
the corner he recognised some embossing in dark
blue&mdash;familiar embossing it was&mdash;of part of the
address in Hill Street!</p>

<p>The paper was that used habitually by Enid
Orlebar, and upon it was a date, two months
before, and the single word "over" in her familiar
handwriting.</p>

<p>He took his stout walking-stick, in reality a
sword-case, and frantically searched for other
scraps, but could find none. One tiny portion
only had been preserved from the flames&mdash;paraffin
having been poured over the heap to
render it the more inflammable. But that scrap
in itself was sufficient proof that Enid had written
to the mysterious tenant of The Yews.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, approaching the sergeant,
"do you think the coast is clear enough?"</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"To get a glimpse inside. There's a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[<a href="./images/281.png">281</a>]</span>
deal more mystery here than we imagine, depend
upon it!" Walter exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Master and man will return by the same
train, I expect, unless they come back in a motor-car.
If they come by train they won't be
here till well past eight, so we'll have at least
three hours by ourselves."</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston glanced around. Twilight
was fast falling.</p>

<p>"It'll be dark inside, but I've brought my
electric torch," he said. "There's a kitchen window
with an ordinary latch."</p>

<p>"That's no use. There are iron bars," declared
the sergeant. "I examined it the other
day. The small staircase window at the side is
the best means of entry." And he took the novelist
round and showed him a long narrow window
about five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Walter's one thought was of Enid. Why
had she written to that mysterious foreigner?
Why had she visited there? Why, indeed, was
she back in England surreptitiously, and in that
neighbourhood?</p>

<p>The short winter's afternoon was nearly at
an end as they stood contemplating the window
prior to breaking in&mdash;for Walter Fetherston felt
justified in breaking the law in order to examine
the interior of that place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
In the dark branches of the trees the wind
whistled mournfully, and the scudding clouds
were precursory of rain.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Walter. "This
isn't a particularly cheerful abode, is it, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, if I lived 'ere I'd have the blues in
a week," laughed the man. "I can't think 'ow
Mr. Bailey employs 'is time."</p>

<p>"Poultry-farming," laughed Fetherston, as,
standing on tiptoe, he examined the window-latch
by flashing on the electric torch.</p>

<p>"No good!" he declared. "There's a shutter
covered with new sheet-iron behind."</p>

<p>"It doesn't show through the curtain," exclaimed
Deacon.</p>

<p>"But it's there. Our friend is evidently
afraid of burglars."</p>

<p>From window to window they passed, but
the mystery was considerably increased by the
discovery that at each of those on the ground
floor were iron-faced shutters, though so placed
as not to be noticeable behind the windows,
which were entirely covered with cheap curtain
muslin.</p>

<p>"That's funny!" exclaimed the sergeant.
"I've never examined them with a light before."</p>

<p>"They have all been newly strengthened,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>
declared Fetherston. "On the other side I expect
there are strips of steel placed lattice-wise,
a favourite device of foreigners. Mr. Bailey,"
he added, "evidently has no desire that any intruder
should gain access to his residence."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked Deacon, for it
was now rapidly growing dark.</p>

<p>A thought had suddenly occurred to Walter
that perhaps Enid's intention was to make a call
there, after all.</p>

<p>"Our only way to obtain entrance is, I think,
by one of the upper windows," replied the man
whose very life was occupied by the investigation
of mysteries. "In the laundry I noticed
a ladder. Let us go and get it."</p>

<p>So the ladder, a rather rotten and insecure
one, was obtained, and after some difficulty
placed against the wall. It would not, however,
reach to the windows, as first intended, therefore
Walter mounted upon the slippery, moss-grown
tiles of a wing of the house, and after a
few moments' exploration discovered a skylight
which proved to be over the head of the servants'
staircase.</p>

<p>This he lifted, and, fixing around a chimney-stack
a strong silk rope he had brought in his
pocket ready for any emergency, he threw it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>
down the opening, and quickly lowered himself
through.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he done so, and was standing on
the uncarpeted stairs, when his quick ear caught
the sound of Deacon's footsteps receding over
the gravel around to the front of the house.</p>

<p>Then, a second later, he heard a loud challenge
from the gloom in a man's voice that was
unfamiliar:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>There was no reply. Walter listened with
bated breath.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" cried the new-comer
in a voice in which was a marked foreign
accent. "Speak! <i>speak!</i> or I'll shoot!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h4>THE SECRET OF THE LONELY HOUSE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Walter</span> did not move. He realised that a <i>contretemps</i>
had occurred. The ladder still leaning
against the wall outside would reveal his intrusion.
Yet, at last inside, he intended, at all
hazards, to explore the place and learn the reason
why the mysterious stranger had started
that "poultry farm."</p>

<p>He was practically in the dark, fearing to
flash on his torch lest he should be discovered.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Bailey or his Italian
manservant had unexpectedly returned!</p>

<p>Those breathless moments seemed hours.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a second challenge. The
challenger used a fierce Italian oath, and by it
he knew that it was Pietro.</p>

<p>In reply, a shot rang out&mdash;evidently from
the sergeant's pistol, followed by another sharp
report, and still another. This action showed
the man Deacon to be a shrewd person, for the
effect was exactly as he had intended. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
Italian servant turned on his heel and flew for
his life down the drive, shouting in his native
tongue for help and for the police.</p>

<p>"Madonna santa!" he yelled. "Who are
you here?" he demanded in Italian. "I'll go to
the police!"</p>

<p>And in terror he rushed off down the road.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," cried the sergeant, after
the servant had disappeared. "I've given the
fellow a good fright. Be quick and have a look
round, sir. You can be out again before he
raises the alarm!"</p>

<p>In an instant Walter flashed on his torch
and, dashing down the stairs, crossed the kitchen
and found himself in the hall. From room to
room he rushed, but found only two rooms on
the ground floor furnished&mdash;a sitting-room,
which had been the original dining-room, while
in the study was a chair-bed, most probably
where Pietro slept.</p>

<p>On the table lay a heavy revolver, fully loaded,
and this Fetherston quickly transferred to
his jacket pocket.</p>

<p>Next moment he dashed up the old well
staircase two steps at a time and entered room
after room. Only one was furnished&mdash;the tenant's
bedroom. In it he found a number of
suits of clothes, while on the dressing-table lay a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
false moustache, evidently for disguise. A small
writing-table was set in the window, and upon
it was strewn a quantity of papers.</p>

<p>As he flashed his torch round he was amazed
to see, arranged upon a neat deal table in a corner,
some curious-looking machinery which
looked something like printing-presses. But
they were a mystery to him.</p>

<p>The discovery was a strange one. What it
meant he did not then realise. There seemed to
be quite a quantity of apparatus and machinery.
It was this which had been conveyed there in
those furniture vans of the Trinity Furnishing
Company.</p>

<p>He heard Deacon's voice calling again.
Therefore, having satisfied himself as to the nature
of the contents of that neglected old house,
he ascended the stone steps into the passage
which led through a faded green-baize door into
the main hall.</p>

<p>As he entered he heard voices in loud discussion.
Sergeant Deacon and the servant Pietro
had met face to face.</p>

<p>The Italian had evidently aroused the villagers
in Asheldham, for there were sounds of
many voices of men out on the gravelled drive.</p>

<p>"I came up here a quarter of an hour ago,"
the Italian cried excitedly in his broken Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>lish,
"and somebody fired at me. They tried to
kill me!"</p>

<p>"But who?" asked Deacon in pretended ignorance.
He was uncertain what to do, Mr.
Fetherston being still within the house and the
ladder, his only means of escape, still standing
against a side wall.</p>

<p>"Thieves!" cried the man, his foreign accent
more pronounced in his excitement. "I
challenged them, and they fired at me. I am
glad that you, a police sergeant, are here."</p>

<p>"So am I," cried Walter Fetherston, suddenly
throwing open the front door and standing
before the knot of alarmed villagers, though
it was so dark that they could not recognise who
he was. "Deacon," he added authoritatively,
"arrest that foreigner."</p>

<p>"Diavolo! Who are you?" demanded the
Italian angrily.</p>

<p>"You will know in due course," replied
Fetherston. Then, turning to the crowd, he
added: "Gentlemen, I came here with Sergeant
Deacon to search this house. He will tell
you whether that statement is true or not."</p>

<p>"Quite," declared the breezy sergeant, who
already had the Italian by the collar and coat-sleeve.
"It was I who fired&mdash;to frighten him
off!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
At this the crowd laughed. They had no
liking for foreigners of any sort after the war,
and were really secretly pleased to see that the
sergeant had "taken him up."</p>

<p>But what for? they asked themselves. Why
had the police searched The Yews? Mr. Bailey
was a quiet, inoffensive man, very free with his
money to everybody around.</p>

<p>"Jack Beard," cried Deacon to a man in the
crowd, "just go down to Asheldham and telephone
to Superintendent Warden at Maldon.
Ask him to send me over three men at once, will
you?"</p>

<p>"All right, Sam," was the prompt reply,
and the man went off, while the sergeant took
the resentful Italian into the house to await an
escort.</p>

<p>Deacon called the assistance of two men and
invited them in. Then, while they mounted
guard over the prisoner, Fetherston addressed
the little knot of amazed men who had been
alarmed by the Italian's statement.</p>

<p>"Listen, gentlemen," he said. "We shall in
a couple of hours' time expect the return of Mr.
Bailey, the tenant of this house. There is a
very serious charge against him. I therefore
put everyone of you upon your honour to say
no word of what has occurred here to-night&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
until Mr. Bailey arrives. I should prefer you
all to remain here and wait; otherwise, if a word
be dropped at Southminster, he may turn back
and fly from justice."</p>

<p>"What's the charge, sir?" asked one man,
a bearded old labourer.</p>

<p>"A very serious one," was Walter's evasive
reply.</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, they all agreed to wait
and witness the dramatic arrest of the man who
was charged with some mysterious offence.
Speculation was rife as to what it would be, and
almost every crime in the calendar was cited as
likely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fetherston, returning to the
barely-furnished sitting-room, interrogated Pietro
in Italian, but only obtained sullen answers.
A loaded revolver had been found upon him by
Deacon, and promptly confiscated.</p>

<p>"I have already searched the place," Walter
said to the prisoner, "and I know what it contains."</p>

<p>But in response the man who had posed as
servant, but who, with his "master," was the
custodian of the place, only grinned and gave
vent to muttered imprecations in Italian.</p>

<p>Fetherston afterwards left the small assembly
and made examination of some bedrooms he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
had not yet inspected. In three of these, the
locks of which he broke open, he discovered
quantities of interesting papers, together with
another mysterious-looking press.</p>

<p>While trying to decide what it all meant he
suddenly heard a great shouting and commotion
outside, and ran down to the door to ascertain
its cause.</p>

<p>As he opened it he saw that in the darkness
the crowd outside had grown excited.</p>

<p>"'Ere you are, sir," cried one man, ascending
the steps. "'Ere are two visitors. We
found 'em comin' up the road, and, seein' us,
they tried to get away!"</p>

<p>Walter held up a hurricane lantern which
he had found and lit, when its dim, uncertain
light fell upon the two prisoners in the crowd.</p>

<p>Behind stood Summers, while before him, to
Fetherston's utter amazement, showed Enid
Orlebar, pale and terrified, and the grey, sinister
face of Doctor Weirmarsh.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h4>CONTAINS SOME STARTLING STATEMENTS</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Enid</span>, recognising Walter, shrank back instantly
in fear and shame, while Weirmarsh started at
that unexpected meeting with the man whom he
knew to be his bitterest and most formidable
opponent.</p>

<p>The small crowd of excited onlookers, ignorant
of the true facts, but their curiosity
aroused by the unusual circumstances, had prevented
the pair from turning back and making
a hurried escape.</p>

<p>"Enid!" exclaimed Fetherston, as the girl
reluctantly crossed the threshold with downcast
head, "what is the meaning of this? Why are
you paying a visit to this house at such an
hour?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Walter," she cried, her small, gloved
hands clenched with a sudden outburst of emotion,
"be patient and hear me! I will tell you
everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>!"</p>

<p>"You won't," growled the doctor sharply.
"If you do, by Gad! it will be the worse for you!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
So you'd best keep a silent tongue&mdash;otherwise
you know the consequences. I shall now tell the
truth&mdash;and you won't like that!"</p>

<p>She drew back in terror of the man who held
such an extraordinary influence over her. She
had grasped Fetherston's hand convulsively,
but at Weirmarsh's threat she had released her
hold and was standing in the hall, pale, rigid and
staring.</p>

<p>"Summers," exclaimed Fetherston, turning
to his companion, "you know this person, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I should rather think I do," replied
the man, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Well, detain him for the present, and take
your instructions from London."</p>

<p>"You have no power or right to detain me,"
declared the grey-faced doctor in quick defiance.
"You are not a police officer!"</p>

<p>"No, but this is a police officer," Fetherston
replied, indicating Summers, and adding: "Sergeant,
I give that man into custody."</p>

<p>The sergeant advanced and laid his big hand
upon the doctor's shoulder, telling him to consider
himself under arrest.</p>

<p>"But this is abominable&mdash;outrageous!"
Weirmarsh cried, shaking him off. "I've committed
no offence."</p>

<p>"That is a matter for later consideration,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
calmly replied the man who had devoted so
much of his time and money to the investigation
of mysteries of crime.</p>

<p>In one of the bare bedrooms upstairs Fetherston
had, in examining one of the well made
hand-presses set up there, found beside it a number
of one-pound Treasury notes. In curiosity
he took one up, and found it to be in an unfinished
state. It was printed in green, without the
brown colouring. Yet it was perfect as regards
the paper and printing&mdash;even to its black serial
number.</p>

<p>Next second the truth flashed upon him.
The whole apparatus, presses and everything,
had been set up there to print the war paper
currency of Great Britain!</p>

<p>In the room adjoining he had seen bundles
of slips of similar paper, all neatly packed in
elastic bands, and waiting the final process of
colouring and toning. One bundle had only the
Houses of Parliament printed; the other side
was blank. He saw in a flash that the placing
in circulation of such a huge quantity of Treasury
notes, amounting to hundreds of thousands
of pounds, must seriously damage the credit of
the nation.</p>

<p>For a few seconds he held an unfinished note
in his hand examining it, and deciding that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
imitation was most perfect. It deceived him
and would undoubtedly deceive any bank-teller.</p>

<p>In those rooms it was plain that various
processes had been conducted, from the manipulation
of the watermark, by a remarkably ingenious
process, right down to the finished one-pound
note, so well done that not even an expert
could detect the forgery. There were many
French one-hundred-franc notes as well.</p>

<p>The whole situation was truly astounding.
Again the thought hammered home: such a
quantity of paper in circulation must affect the
national finances of Britain. And at the head
of the band who were printing and circulating
those spurious notes was the mysterious medical
man who carried on his practice in Pimlico!</p>

<p>The scene within the sparsely furnished
house containing those telltale presses was indeed
a weird one.</p>

<p>Somebody had found a cheap paraffin lamp
and lit it in the sitting-room, where they were
all assembled, the front door having been closed.</p>

<p>It was apparent that Pietro was no stranger
to the doctor and his fair companion, but both
men were highly resentful that they had been
so entrapped.</p>

<p>"Doctor Weirmarsh," exclaimed Fetherston
seriously, as he stood before him, "I have just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
examined this house and have ascertained what
it contains."</p>

<p>"You've told him!" cried the man, turning
fiercely upon Enid. "You have betrayed me!
Ah! It will be the worse for you&mdash;and for your
family," he added harshly. "You will see! I
shall now reveal the truth concerning your stepfather,
and you and your family will be held up
to opprobrium throughout the whole length and
breadth of your land."</p>

<p>Enid did not reply. She was pale as death,
her face downcast, her lips white as marble. She
knew, alas! that Weirmarsh, now that he was
cornered, would not spare her.</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;a very painful pause.</p>

<p>Everyone next instant listened to a noise
which sounded outside. As it grew nearer it
grew more distinct&mdash;the whir of an approaching
motor-car.</p>

<p>It pulled up suddenly before the door, and
a moment later the old bell clanged loudly
through the half-empty house.</p>

<p>Fetherston left the room, and going to the
door, threw it open, when yet another surprise
awaited him.</p>

<p>Upon the steps stood four men in thick overcoats,
all of whom Walter instantly recognised.</p>

<p>With Trendall stood Sir Hugh Elcombe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
while their companions were two detective-inspectors
from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"Hallo!&mdash;Fetherston!" gasped Trendall.
"I&mdash;I expected to find Weirmarsh here! What
has happened?"</p>

<p>"The doctor is already here," was the other's
quick reply. "I have found some curious
things in this place! Secret printing-presses for
forged notes."</p>

<p>"We already know that," he said. "Sir
Hugh Elcombe here has, unknown to us, obtained
certain knowledge, and to-day he came
to me and gave me a full statement of what has
been in progress. What he has told me this
afternoon is among the most valuable and reliable
information that we ever received."</p>

<p>"I know something of the scoundrels," remarked
the old general, "because&mdash;well, because,
as I have confessed to Mr. Trendall, I
yielded to temptation long ago and assisted
them."</p>

<p>"Whatever you have done, Sir Hugh, you
have at least revealed to us the whole plot. Only
by pretending to render assistance to these
scoundrels could you have gained the intensely
valuable knowledge which you've imparted to
me to-day," replied the keen-faced director from
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>
Fetherston realised instantly that the fine old
fellow, whom he had always held in such esteem,
was making every effort to atone for his conduct
in the past; but surely that was not the
moment to refer to it&mdash;so he ushered the four
men into the ill-lit dining-room wherein the others
were standing, none knowing how next to
act.</p>

<p>When the doctor and Sir Hugh faced each
other there was a painful silence for a few seconds.</p>

<p>To Weirmarsh Trendall was known by
sight, therefore the criminal saw that the game
was up, and that Sir Hugh had risked his own
reputation in betraying him.</p>

<p>"You infernal scoundrel!" cried the doctor
angrily. "You&mdash;to whom I have paid so many
thousands of pounds&mdash;have given me away! But
I'll be even with you!"</p>

<p>"Say what you like," laughed the old general
in defiance. "To me it is the same whatever
you allege. I have already admitted my
slip from the straight path. I do not deny receiving
money from your hands, nor do I deny
that, in a certain measure, I have committed serious
offences&mdash;because, having taken one step,
you forced me on to others, always holding over
me the threat of exposure and ruin. But, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>tunately,
one day, in desperation, I took Enid
yonder into my confidence. It was she who suggested
that I might serve the ends of justice,
and perhaps atone for what I had already done,
by learning your secrets, and, when the time was
ripe, revealing all the interesting details to our
authorities. Enid became your friend and the
friend of your friends. She risked everything&mdash;her
honour, her happiness, her future&mdash;by associating
with you for the one and sole purpose
of assisting me to learn all the dastardly plot in
progress."</p>

<p>"It was you who supplied Paul Le Pontois
with the false notes he passed in France!" declared
Weirmarsh. "The French police know
that; and if ever you or your step-daughter put
foot in France you will be arrested."</p>

<p>"Evidently you are unaware, Doctor, that
my son-in-law, Paul Le Pontois, was released
yesterday," laughed Sir Hugh in triumph.
"Your treachery, which is now known by the
S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, defeated its own ends."</p>

<p>"Further," remarked Walter Fetherston,
turning to Enid, "it was this man here"&mdash;and
he indicated the grey-faced doctor of Pimlico&mdash;"this
man who denounced you and Sir Hugh to
the French authorities, and had you not heeded
my warning you both would then have been ar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>rested.
He had evidently suspected the object
of your friendliness with me&mdash;that you both intended
to reveal the truth&mdash;and he adopted that
course in order to secure your incarceration in a
foreign prison, and so close your lips."</p>

<p>"I knew you suspected me all along, Walter,"
replied the girl, standing a little aside and
suddenly clutching his hand. "But you will
forgive me now&mdash;forgive me, won't you?" she
implored, looking up into his dark, determined
face.</p>

<p>"Of course," he replied, "I have already
forgiven you. I had no idea of the true reason
of your association with this man."</p>

<p>And he raised her gloved hand and carried
it gallantly to his eager lips.</p>

<p>"Though more than mere suspicion has rested
upon you," he went on, "you and your stepfather
deserve the heartiest thanks of the nation
for risking everything in order to be in a position
to reveal this dastardly financial plot. That
man there"&mdash;and he indicated the doctor&mdash;"deserves
all he'll get!"</p>

<p>The doctor advanced threateningly, and,
drawing a big automatic revolver from his pocket,
would have fired at the man who had spoken
his mind so freely had not Deacon, quick as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
lightning, sprung forward and wrenched the
weapon so that the bullet went upward.</p>

<p>White with anger and chagrin, the doctor
stood roundly abusing the man who had investigated
that lonely house.</p>

<p>But Fetherston laughed, which only irritated
him the more. He raved like a caged lion, until
the veins in his brow stood out in great knots;
but, finding all protests and allegations useless,
he at last became quiet again, and apparently began
to review the situation from a purely philosophical
standpoint, until, some ten minutes
later, another motor-car dashed up and in it were
an inspector and four plain-clothes constables,
who had been sent over from Maldon in response
to Deacon's message for assistance.</p>

<p>When they entered Pietro became voluble,
but the narrow-eyed doctor of Pimlico remained
sullen and silent, biting his lips. He saw that he
had been entrapped by the very man whom he
had believed to be as clay in his hands.</p>

<p>The scene was surely exciting as well as impressive.
The half-furnished, ill-lit dining-room
was full of excited men, all talking at once.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, Walter drew Enid into the shadow,
and in a few brief, passionate words reassured
her of his great affection.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, bursting into hot tears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>
"your words, Walter, have lifted a great load of
sorrow and apprehension from my mind, for I
feared that when you knew the truth you would
never, never forgive."</p>

<p>"But I have forgiven," he whispered, pressing
her hand.</p>

<p>"Then wait until we are alone, and I will
tell you everything. Ah! you do not know, Walter,
what I have suffered&mdash;what a terrible strain
I have sustained in these days of terror!"</p>

<p>But scarcely had she uttered those words
when the door reopened and a man was ushered
in by Deacon, who had gone out in response to
the violent ringing of the bell.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Bailey, tenant of the house,
gentlemen," said the sergeant, introducing him
with mock politeness.</p>

<p>Fetherston glanced up, and to his surprise
saw standing in the doorway a man he had
known, and whose movements he had so closely
followed&mdash;the man who had gone to Monte Carlo
for instructions, and perhaps payment&mdash;the
man who had passed as Monsieur Granier!</p>

<h4>REVEALS A WOMAN'S LOVE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> was the consternation caused in the
neighbourhood of the sleepy old-world village
of Asheldham when it became known that the
quiet, mild-mannered tenant of The Yews had
been arrested by the Maldon police.</p>

<p>Of what transpired within those grim walls
only the two men called to his assistance by Sergeant
Deacon knew, and to them both the inspector
from Maldon, as well as Trendall, expressed
a fervent hope that they would regard
the matter as strictly confidential.</p>

<p>"You see, gentlemen," added Trendall, "we
are not desirous that the public should know of
our discovery. We wish to avoid creating undue
alarm, and at the same time to conceal the
very existence of our system of surveillance
upon those suspected. Therefore, I trust that
all of you present will assist my department by
preserving silence as to what has occurred here
this evening."</p>

<p>His hearers agreed willingly, and through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span>
the next hour the place was thoroughly searched,
the bundles of spurious notes&mdash;the finished ones
representing nearly one hundred thousand
pounds ready to put into circulation&mdash;being
seized.</p>

<p>One of the machines they found was for
printing in the serial numbers in black, a process
which, with genuine notes, is done by hand.
Truly, the gang had brought the art of forgery
to perfection.</p>

<p>"Well," said Trendall when they had finished,
"this work of yours, Sir Hugh, certainly
deserves the highest commendation. You have
accomplished what we, with all our great organisation,
utterly failed to do."</p>

<p>"I have to-day tried to atone for my past offences,"
was the stern old man's hoarse reply.</p>

<p>"And you have succeeded, Sir Hugh," declared
Trendall. "Indeed you have!"</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the excitement among
the crowd waiting outside in the light of the
head-lamps of the motor-cars was increased by
the appearance of the doctor, escorted by
two Maldon police officers in plain clothes.
They mounted a police car, and were driven
away down the road, while into a second car the
tenant of The Yews and his Italian manservant
were placed under escort, and also driven away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>
The station-fly, in which Bailey had driven
from Southminster, conveyed away Fetherston,
Trendall, Sir Hugh, and Enid, while Deacon,
with two men, was left in charge of the house
of secrets.</p>

<p>It was past one o'clock in the morning when
Walter Fetherston stood alone with Enid in the
pretty drawing-room in Hill Street.</p>

<p>They stood together upon the <i>vieux rose</i>
hearthrug, his hand was upon her shoulder, his
deep, earnest gaze fixed upon hers. In her
splendid eyes the love light showed. They had
both admired each other intensely from their
first meeting, and had become very good and
staunch friends. Walter Fetherston had only
once spoken of the passion that had constantly
consumed his heart&mdash;when they were by the blue
sea at Biarritz. He loved her&mdash;loved her with
the whole strength of his being&mdash;and yet, ah! try
how he would, he could never put aside the dark
cloud of suspicion which, as the days went by,
became more and more impenetrable.</p>

<p>Sweet-faced, frank, and open, she stood, the
ideal of the English outdoor girl, merry, quick-witted,
and athletic. And yet, after the stress
of war, she had sacrificed all that she held most
dear in order to become the friend of Weirmarsh.
Why?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
"Enid," he said at last, his tender hand still
upon her shoulder, "why did you not tell me
your true position? You were working in the
same direction, with the same strong motive of
patriotism, as myself!"</p>

<p>She was silent, very pale, and very serious.</p>

<p>"I feared to tell you, Walter," she faltered.
"How could I possibly reveal to you the truth
when I knew you were aware how my stepfather
had unconsciously betrayed his friends? You
judged us both as undesirables, therefore any
attempt at explanation would, I know, only aggravate
our offence in your eyes. Ah! you do
not know how intensely I have suffered! How
bitter it all was! I knew the reason you followed
us to France&mdash;to watch and confirm your suspicions."</p>

<p>"I admit, Enid, that I suspected you of being
in the hands of a set of scoundrels," her lover
said in a low, hoarse voice. "At first I hesitated
whether to warn you of your peril after Weirmarsh
had, with such dastardly cunning, betrayed
you to the French police, but&mdash;well," he
added as he looked again into her dear eyes long
and earnestly, "I loved you, Enid," he blurted
forth. "I told you so! Remember, dear, what
you said at Biarritz? And I love you&mdash;and because
of that I resolved to save you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
"Which you did," she said in a strained, mechanical
tone. "We both have you to thank for
our escape. Weirmarsh, having first implicated
Paul, then made allegations against us, in order
to send us to prison, because he feared lest my
stepfather might, in a fit of remorse, act indiscreetly
and make a confession."</p>

<p>"The past will all be forgiven now that Sir
Hugh has been able to expose and unmask
Weirmarsh and his band," Walter assured her.
"A great sensation may possibly result, but it
will, in any case, show that even though an Englishman
may be bought, he can still remain honest.
And," he added, "it will also show them
that there is at least one brave woman in England
who sacrificed her love&mdash;for I know well,
Enid, that you fully reciprocate the great affection
I feel towards you&mdash;in order to bear her
noble part in combating a wily and unscrupulous
gang."</p>

<p>"It was surely my duty," replied the girl
simply, her eyes downcast in modesty. "Yet
association with that dastardly blackguard, Dr.
Weirmarsh, was horrible! How I refrained
from turning upon him through all those months
I cannot really tell. I detested him from the
first moment Sir Hugh invited him to our table;
and though I went to assist him under guise of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
consultations, I acted with one object all along,"
she declared, her eyes raised to his and flashing,
"to expose him in his true guise&mdash;that of Josef
Blot, the head of the most dangerous association
of forgers, of international thieves and blackmailers
known to the police for the past half a
century."</p>

<p>"Which you have surely done! You have
revealed the whole plot, and confounded those
who were so cleverly conspiring to effect a sudden
and most gigantic coup. But&mdash;&mdash;" and he
paused, still looking into her eyes through his
pince-nez, and sighed.</p>

<p>"But what?" she asked, in some surprise at
his sudden change of manner.</p>

<p>"There is one matter, Enid, which"&mdash;and
he paused&mdash;"well, which is still a mystery to me,
and I&mdash;I want you to explain it," he said in slow
deliberation.</p>

<p>"What is that?" she asked, looking at him
quickly.</p>

<p>"The mystery which you have always refused
to assist me in unravelling&mdash;the mystery
of the death of Harry Bellairs," was his quiet
reply. "You held him in high esteem; you
loved him," he added in a voice scarce above a
whisper.</p>

<p>She drew back, her countenance suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
blanched as she put her hand quickly to her brow
and reeled slightly as though she had been dealt
a blow.</p>

<p>Walter watched her in blank wonderment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h4>IN WHICH SIR HUGH TELLS HIS STORY</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> know the truth, don't you, dearest?"
Walter asked at last in that quiet, sympathetic
tone which he always adopted towards her whom
he loved so well.</p>

<p>Enid nodded in the affirmative, her face hard
and drawn.</p>

<p>"He was killed, was he not&mdash;deliberately
murdered?"</p>

<p>For a few seconds the silence was unbroken
save for a whir of a taxicab passing outside.</p>

<p>"Yes," was her somewhat reluctant response.</p>

<p>"You went to his rooms that afternoon,"
Walter asserted point blank.</p>

<p>"I do not deny that. I followed him home&mdash;to&mdash;to
save him."</p>

<p>There was a break in her voice as she stammered
out the last words, and tears rushed into
her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"From what? From death?"</p>

<p>"No, from falling a prey to a great temptation
set before him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By the doctor, to whom my stepfather had
introduced him," was the girl's reply. "I discovered
by mere chance that the doctor, who had
somewhat got him into his clutches, had approached
him in order to induce him to allow
him to take a wax impression of a certain safe
key belonging to a friend of his named Thurston,
a diamond broker in Hatton Garden. He
had offered him a very substantial sum to do
this&mdash;a sum which would have enabled him to
clear off all his debts and start afresh. Harry's
younger brother Bob had got into a mess, and
in helping him out Harry had sadly entangled
himself and was practically face to face with
bankruptcy. I knew this, and I knew what a
great temptation had been placed before him.
Fearing lest, in a moment of despair, he might
accept, I went, by appointment, to his chambers
as soon as I arrived in London. Barker, his
man, had been sent out, and we were alone. I
found him in desperation, yet to my great delight
he had defied Weirmarsh, saying he refused
to betray his friend."</p>

<p>"And what did Bellairs tell you further?"</p>

<p>"He expressed suspicion that my stepfather
was in the doctor's pay," she replied. "I tried
to convince him to the contrary, but Weir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>marsh's
suggestion had evidently furnished the
key to some suspicious document which he had
one day found on Sir Hugh's writing-table."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," she went on slowly, "we quarrelled.
I was indignant that he should suspect my stepfather,
and he was full of vengeance against Sir
Hugh's friend the doctor. Presently I left, and&mdash;and
I never saw him again alive!"</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"What happened is explained by this letter,"
she replied, crossing to a little buhl bureau
which she unlocked, taking out a sealed envelope.
On breaking it open and handing it to him
she said: "This is the letter he wrote to me with
his dying hand. I have kept it a secret&mdash;a secret
even from Sir Hugh."</p>

<p>Walter read the uneven lines eagerly. They
grew more shaky and more illegible towards the
end, but they were sufficient to make the truth
absolutely clear.</p>

<p>"To-night, half an hour ago," (wrote the
dying man) "I had a visit from your friend,
Weirmarsh. We were alone, with none to overhear,
so I told him plainly that I intended to
expose him. At first he became defiant, but
presently he grew apprehensive, and on taking
his leave he made a foul accusation against you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[<a href="./images/313.png">313</a>]</span>
Then, laughing at my refusal to accept his
bribe, the scoundrel took my hand in farewell.
He must have had a pin stuck in his glove, for I
felt a slight scratch across the palm. At the
moment I was too furious to pay any attention
to it, but ten minutes after he had gone I began
to experience a strange faintness. I feel now
fainter . . . and fainter . . . A strange feeling
has crept over me . . . I am dying . . .
poisoned . . . by that king of thieves!</p>

<p>"Come to me quickly . . . at once . . .
Enid . . . and tell me that what he has said
against you . . . is not true. It . . . it cannot
be true. . . . Don't delay. Come quickly. . . .
Can't write more.&mdash;Harry."</p>

<p>Walter paused for a second after reading
through that dramatic letter, the last effort of a
dying man.</p>

<p>"And that scoundrel Weirmarsh killed him
because he feared exposure," he remarked in a
low, hard voice. "Why did you not bring this
forward at the inquest?"</p>

<p>"For several reasons," replied the girl. "I
feared the doctor's reprisals. Besides, he might
easily have denied the allegation, or he might
have used the same means to close my lips if he
had suspected that I had learnt the truth."</p>

<p>"The dead man's story is no doubt true," de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[<a href="./images/314.png">314</a>]</span>clared
Fetherston. "He used some deadly poison&mdash;one
of the newly discovered ones which
leaves no trace&mdash;to kill his victim who, in all
probability, was not his first. Your stepfather
does not know, of course, that this letter exists?"</p>

<p>"No. I have kept it from everyone. I said
that the summons I received from him I had destroyed."</p>

<p>"In the circumstances I will ask you, Enid,
to allow me to retain it," he said. "I want to
show it to Trendall."</p>

<p>"You may show it to Mr. Trendall, but I
ask you, for the present, to make no further use
of it," replied the girl.</p>

<p>He moved a step closer to her and caught her
disengaged hand in his, the glad light in her eyes
telling him that his action was one which she
reciprocated, yet some sense of her unworthiness
of this great love causing her to hesitate.</p>

<p>"I will promise," said the strong, manly fellow
in a low tone. "I ought to have made allowances,
but, in the horror of my suspicion, I
did not, and I'm sorry. I love you, Enid&mdash;I had
never really loved until I met you, until I held
your hand in mine!"</p>

<p>Enid's true, overburdened heart was only too
ready to respond to his fervent appeal. She
suffered her lover to draw her to himself, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>
their lips met in a long, passionate caress that
blotted out all the past. He spoke quick, rapid
words of ardent affection. To Enid, after all
the hideous events she had passed through, it
seemed too happy to be true that so much bliss
was in store for her, and she remained there,
with Walter's arm around her, silently content,
that fervid kiss being the first he had ever imprinted
upon her full red lips.</p>

<p>Thus they remained in each other's arms,
their two true hearts beating in unison, their
kisses mingling, their twin souls united in the
first moments of their newly-found ecstasy of
perfect love.</p>

<p>The fight had been a fierce one, but their true
hearts had won, and, as they whispered each other's
fond affection, Enid promised to be the
wife of the honest, fearless man of whose magnificent
work in the detection of crime the country
had never dreamed. They read his books
and were enthralled by them, but little did they
think that he was one of the never-sleeping
watch-dogs upon great criminals, or that the
sweet-faced girl, who was now his affianced wife,
had risked her life, her love, her honour, in order
to assist him.</p>

<p>Next afternoon Sir Hugh called upon Walter
at his dingy chambers in Holles Street, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>
as they sat together the old general, after a long
and somewhat painful silence, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I know, Fetherston, that you must be mystified
how, in my position, I should have become
implicated in the doings of that criminal gang."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," Walter declared.</p>

<p>"Well, briefly, it occurred in this way," said
the old officer. "While I was a colonel in India
just before the war I was very hard pressed for
money and had committed a fault&mdash;an indiscretion
for which I might easily have been dismissed <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing word 'from'">from</ins>
the army. On being recalled to London, after
war had been declared, I was approached by the
fellow Weirmarsh who, to my horror, had, by
some unaccountable means, obtained knowledge
of my indiscretion! At first he adopted a high
moral tone, upbraiding me for my fault and
threatening to inform against me. This I
begged him not to do. For a fortnight he kept
me in an agony of despair, when one day he
called me to him and unfolded to me a scheme
by which I could make a considerable amount of
money; indeed, he promised to pay me a yearly
sum for my assistance."</p>

<p>"You thought him to be a doctor&mdash;and nothing
else?" Walter said.</p>

<p>"Exactly. I never dreamed until quite recently
that he was head of such a formidable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span>
gang, whose operations were upon so extensive
a scale as to endanger our national credit," replied
Sir Hugh. "At the time he approached
me I was in the Pay Department, and many
thousands of pounds in Treasury notes were
passing through my safe weekly. His suggestion
was that I should exchange the notes as they
came to me from the Treasury for those with
which he would supply me, and which, on showing
me a specimen, I failed to distinguish from
the real. I hesitated; I was hard up. To sustain
my position after my knighthood money
was absolutely necessary to me, and for a long
time I had been unable to make both ends meet.
The bait he dangled before me was sufficiently
tempting, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I fell!" he groaned,
and then after a pause he went on:</p>

<p>"Whence Weirmarsh obtained the packets
of notes which I substituted for genuine ones
was, of course, a mystery, but once having taken
the false step it was not my business to inquire.
Not until quite recently did I discover his real
position as chief of a gang of international
crooks, who combined forgery with blackmail
and theft upon a colossal scale. That he intended
Bellairs should furnish him with an impression
of the safe key of a diamond dealer in Hatton
Garden is now plain. Bellairs defied him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[<a href="./images/318.png">318</a>]</span>
and threatened to denounce him to the police.
Therefore, the poor fellow's lips were quickly
closed by the scoundrel, who would hesitate at
nothing in order to preserve his guilty secrets."</p>

<p>"But what caused you to break from him at
last?" inquired Walter eagerly.</p>

<p>"Just before the armistice he and his friends
had conceived a gigantic scheme by which
Europe and the United States were to be flooded
with great quantities of spurious paper currency,
and though it would, when discovered&mdash;as
it must have been sooner or later&mdash;have injured
the national credit, would bring huge fortunes
to him and his friends. He was pressing me to
send in my papers and go to America, there to
act as their agent at a huge remuneration. They
wanted a man of standing who should be above
suspicion, and he had decided to use me as his
tool to engineer the gigantic frauds."</p>

<p>"And you, happily, refused?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I resolved, rather than act further,
to relinquish the handsome payments he made
to me from time to time. For that reason I got
transferred from the Pay Department, so that
I could no longer be of much use to him, a fact
which annoyed him greatly."</p>

<p>"And he threatened you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was constantly doing so. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[<a href="./images/319.png">319</a>]</span>
wanted me to go to New York. Enid helped
me and gave me courage to defy him&mdash;which I
did. Then he conceived a dastardly revenge by
anonymously denouncing Le Pontois as a forger,
and implicating both Enid and myself.
He contrived that some money I brought from
England should be exchanged for spurious
notes, and these Paul unsuspiciously gave into
the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais. Had it not been for your
timely warning, Fetherston, we should both
have also been arrested in France without a
doubt."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other. "I was watching,
and realised your peril, though I confess that
my position was one of extreme difficulty. I, of
course, did not know the actual truth, and, to
be frank, I suspected both Enid and yourself of
being implicated in some very serious crime."</p>

<p>"So we were," he said in a low, hard voice.</p>

<p>"True. But you have both been the means
of revealing to the Treasury a state of things
of which they never dreamed, and by turning
King's evidence and giving the names and addresses
of members of the gang in Brussels and
Paris, all of whom are now under arrest, you
have saved the country from considerable peril.
Had the plot succeeded, a very serious state of
things must have resulted, for the whole of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[<a href="./images/320.png">320</a>]</span>
paper currency would have been suspected. For
that reason the authorities have, I understand,
now that they have arrested the gang and seized
their presses, decided to hush up the whole matter."</p>

<p>"You know this?" asked Sir Hugh, suddenly
brightening.</p>

<p>"Yes, Trendall told me so this morning."</p>

<p>"Ah! Thank Heaven!" he gasped, much
relieved. "Then I can again face the world a
free man. God knows how terribly I suffered
through all those years of the war. I paid for
my fault very dearly&mdash;I assure you, Fetherston."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> remains to be related is quickly told,
though the public have, until now, been in ignorance
of the truth.</p>

<p>Out of evil a great good had come. At noon
on the following day Trendall had an interview
with Josef Blot, alias Weirmarsh, in his cell at
Chelmsford, whither he had been conveyed by
the police. What happened at that interview
will never be known. It is safe to surmise, however,
that the tragic letter of Harry Bellairs was
shown to him&mdash;Enid having withdrawn her request
that no use should be made of it. An hour
after the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department
had left, the prisoner was found lying
stark dead, suffering from a scratch on the wrist,
inflicted with a short, hollow needle which he had
carried concealed behind the lapel of his coat.</p>

<p>Greatly to the discomfiture of the gang, the
man Granier and his servant Pietro were extradited
to France for trial, while a quantity of
jewellery, works of art, money and negotiable
securities of all sorts were unearthed from a villa
near Fontainebleau and restored to their owners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>
A fortnight after Weirmarsh's death, at St.
George's, Hanover Square, Enid Orlebar became
the wife of Walter Fetherston, and among
the guests at the wedding were a number of
strange men in whose position or profession nobody
pretended to be interested. Truth to tell,
they were officials of various grades from Scotland
Yard, surely the most welcome among the
wedding guests.</p>

<p>Though Walter and Enid live in idyllic happiness
in a charming old ivy-grown manor house
in Sussex, with level lawns and shady rose arbours,
they still retain that old cottage at Idsworth,
where a plausible excuse has been given
to the country folk for "Mr. Maltwood" having
been compelled to change his name. No pair in
the whole of England are happier to-day.</p>

<p>No man holds his wife more dear, or has a
more loving and hopeful companion. Their life
is one of perfect and abiding peace and of sweet
content.</p>

<p>Walter Fetherston is not by any means idle,
for in his quiet country home he still writes those
marvellous mystery stories which hold the world
breathlessly enthralled, but he continues to devote
half his time to combating the ingenuity
